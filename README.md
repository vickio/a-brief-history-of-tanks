# A Brief History of Tanks

This is my entry for the r/proceduralgeneration [Procedural Challenge #3 - Armoured Fighting Vehicles](https://www.reddit.com/r/proceduralgeneration/comments/c7pcnk/procedural_challenge_3_armoured_fighting_vehicles/). It is a simple GPT-2 powered tank name and description generator. For sample output of 350 tanks, see [A Brief History of Tanks.md](A Brief History of Tanks.md). Here are few hand-picked examples:

> ## KONKEY
>
> The Konkey armored vehicle was introduced into the United States military after NATO forces in Georgia forced Turkey to invade the country. At the time, Georgia was friendly to the United States and been constructing Soviet-era tanks that looked similar to what the Americans had built at home. Its main goal was to defend the Russian Orthodox Church from Nazism, and it was found very effective. The engine of this vehicle is an Allison V-10 engine that powers the tank’s basic functions while adding several specific upgrades that make the vehicle extremely powerful. The Konkey’s appearance features a very recognizable gold-tinted interior, a camouflage pattern, and distinctive flash lights. The Konkey tank was first deployed in 1975.

> ## EVIL UNIT
>
> The Evil Unit tank was an experimental military vehicle powered by military technology. The tank’s size and design were described as equivalent to the legendary Hydra, Russian armored troop transport. The prototype military transporter was piloted by a human participant in this project who later sacrificed his life due to a health condition requiring treatment. The tank’s speed was limited and it had extreme amounts of vibration and induced sickness, the mating ability of its engine only allowed it to emit intense bloodlust. This design was successful and has proven successful at all levels of service despite being more cumbersome than most tanks due to its very bulky design. The Evil Unit’s maneuverability was incredible and it used large portions of the high pressure accumulator of a high voltage power pack which resembled a powered blood shower and was capable of returning the affected individuals to normalcy within about 30 minutes.

> ## SHANNON-RUMBLE
>
> The Shannon-Rumble tank was developed by Time Corporation. The armor is based on the very best materials made by the kinetic energy engine of Nerv. The controls and computer interface are located on the underside of the tank. The armaments consists of the M79A3 cannon and the M55A5 missile launchers. The Shannon-Rumble’s ability to inflict heavy damage is attributed to its suitability against mechanized and armored targets. The Shannon-Rumble is known for being able to strike targets, even without exploding, from concealed positions or while in foliage or other obstructions. Notably, it also can hit targets at night.

> ## HOBGOBLIN
>
> The Hobgoblin tank was originally created and armored by a Dwarven spy as a base for transporting guns that other Dwarves had trained. It is often placed into combat against Dwarves who wish to hold back their own power or attack other groups of Dwarves at a possible location. Notably, it can outgun almost any other tank when mounted and maintained properly. The engine of the tank is also exposed and in a sense is only protected by thick blanket, but it is capable of complex maneuvers. The Hobgoblin tank is considered relatively simple in how it is given, being constructed almost entirely of wood and stone. The Hobgoblin was designed by Bosco Sciabarra in Alabyss in order to outflank and destroy each of the four great horsemen of the apocalypse.

> ## MIDNIGHT UNICORN
>
> The Midnight Unicorn tank was developed by the <Systems Engineering> Department of United Aerospace Corporation (UAC) for its high-speed naval warfare programs, based on both the Zu-2 and the M-100T medium tanks. Initializing tank production in 2016 on Project Ranulf, this chassis was named-after the night skies. The armaments in the armored tank are as follows: Short, standard-issue 12.7mm cannon. The tank’s maneuverability was optimized. One forward 6-tube turret houses a four-tube reloading armament and a single AAA launcher (AMAT) rack. Notably, one of the four turret mounts carries two recoilless rifles - the SPAAG. The Midnight Unicorn is often seen moving ahead of the section in which it is mounted.

> ## SILVER MECH
>
> The Silver Mech armored vehicle is meant to respond effectively to danger. It has high self-defense and sustained firepower in its hands, suitable to any kind of urban environment. The tank lacks a shell, but can be armed with well-aimed rounds. The Silver Mech tank was designed to be held in place or dismounted in battle by seven slender heavy human units. The tank has a large visor and wide interior openings for fitting two large men into a place where they will not be able to hide. It has five individual fuel tanks inside which can store 30 kilograms of fuel. Seven gung ho motor-driven troops can ride its articulated tracks for long periods of time. Historically, the armored tank was used against industrialized, guerrilla forces.

> ## ROCKER
>
> The Rocker tank was introduced in the Third War for resources within the galaxy. The Rocker is known for its speed, resilience and reliance on organic clay-based armor. While it is quite resilient and resistant to most firepower it lacks some sort of invulnerability. The tank has massive missile tubes and plasma cannons, and its crew carry high caliber armors which are commonly preferred by mounted units or mechanized units. The engine is standard but is very quiet with no turbocharger. The Rocker’s ability to carry missiles allows it to take advantage of the vehicles vast role in the suppression of wide ranges of enemy forces. It has been used as a standard assault weapon for by our military since the early days of the Mandalorian Wars. The Rocker tank is often seen running together with planetary hull bolters or battle cannons.
