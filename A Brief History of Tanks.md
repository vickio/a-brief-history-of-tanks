# A Brief History of Tanks

## BISMARCK 2

The BISMARCK 2 armored vehicle is a versatile platform for ground warfare, including heavy weaponry, repair, and support of its customers. The tank's speed, battery life, range, protection, and vulnerability ensure long-range support of deployments, airfield targets, and any contingency operations, while having the potential to protect the operators in a conventional or a hybrid roles. The tank was developed with an impressive list of advantages that make it an ideal multipurpose platform. It is the result of collaboration between BMD, armored car and diesel engine departments of the Co-Technology Center; it comes with an engineering application or service, was approved by the National Defense University (NDU), and was prepared in cooperation with weapons manufacturers Germany and Russia. The BISMARCK 2 tank was delivered in 2016, is under the BMP-2 intermediate cartridge, which the troop vehicle can be upgraded for missions and operations. The BISMARCK 2 has a protected and armored trailer with protection; when extended it can extend its external tank. The armaments equipped on the BISMARCK 2 include: 7.62mm, 125mm ER gun; 2xM150T 125mm machine gun; 2xM105T 240mm machine gun; 8.7mm BM-21 105mm machine gun; Pz.Kpfw. The engine of BISMARCK 2 is derived from the BMP-2E 120mm smoothbore main gun.

## ZOIAPHON

The Zoiaphon tank is powered by 12 × GM 4500 5.6 hp engine, with bimodal hydraulic stabilizer and a crew of four. Like all other armored vehicles that work with GM gas engines, the Zoiaphon is totally passive, allowing its operators to survive in hostile situations. The tank has two spare tracks in the middle, connected to the rear track of the hull via mounted armor plate. This design holds two zig-zag tracks, using 500 sprocket hull plate to track individual tracks. The tank lacks mobility when traversing surfaces without armor, so only one track is mounted to each hull plate. The armaments on Zoiaphon were: 1 × 180 mm armor-piercing/compensated mounted MG 6 L/38 gun, modified to carry 7x20mm GP38 cannon and automatic gun-barrel system. The Zoiaphon tank uses twin 5 cm M3 Machine guns with 125 rounds each, which shoot different types of armaments in order to be useful in tactical situations.

## SNOW ANGEL

The Snow Angel armored vehicle was produced by Milspec Industries (San Diego, California). The armaments include a 75 mm, 152 mm, 120 mm cannon (regular), 45 mm, and. The tank's speed can reach 70 km/h (45 mph) and 65 km/h (43 mph).The tank is designed for target support and road operations and is supported by a mobile magazine capable of being towed and mounted on the ground. The sub-model is capable of driving 10 km/h (6 mph) and 17 km/h (11 mph). The Snow Angel was developed by Milspec's Goran Gusev Technical Research and Development Center. The Snow Angel's appearance refers to the maroon armor coat that appears on the snow in the Kirov Region. The Snow Angel is equipped with a 75 mm, 152 mm, 120 mm cannon and 90 mm machine gun. The Snow Angel's size is 135 mm (49.6 in) long.

## VALORYKA

The Valoryka tank was first produced by the Federal Army as an armored reconnaissance unit of the South African army in June 1957 and armed with a three-round 122mm autoloader (AS-53). The tank lacks a hull traverse of 45° and a frontal armor penetration of 6.1 mm. The tank is armed with three 107mm cannon. Its ability to mount shells in the existing British AS-19 armored ammunition based on the Swiss M1948 rifle cartridge was not utilized in this vehicle, but two new rifle ammunition cartridges were developed by the Falkland Islands Service using the seven cartridge in 10X106 high-velocity musket-mounted cartridges of the. Notably, the shells available were plastic-coated aluminium and non-tripodized. The Valoryka is considered to be of the class A production as its technical specifications match the APC. The Valoryka was considered to be used on beaches since its penetrator wheel was longer than the Skjold armor on the vehicle, allowing it to use steel tracks. Since the Valoryka was judged to be extremely formidable for its testing, it was never available for field service.

## STARIOM 29

The Stariom 29 tank was one of the early prototype armored vehicles of the period. The tank's size had been added for protection from improvised explosive devices (IEDs), which became routine during World War II, due to the popularity of such weapons, in particular at the end of WWII. The engine and gun development were completed in 1948, and the vehicle was initially used by the Soviet forces in the Far East. On the other hand, the weight of the vehicle was considerably more, around 20 tons. It was originally replaced by the same tank that went into service as the T-26 on April 26, 1968, to counterthe declining popularity of the T-28 design.The first demonstration of the armored vehicle on September 7, 1990 ended in disaster, when the tank fell into the Minsk River. The Stariom 29 lacks 100mm armor (the combination of the tanks' gun-tanks) and its range was also quite limited, due to the quantity of infantry vehicles on the front. Its armor was completely destroyed by the Volga River; another demonstration ended in disaster when the tank dropped 20 tons to its death from a 4,000 meters height.Two Stariom 29 prototypes were built in 1950. The Stariom 29's maneuverability was somewhat limited; it had to make steep turns and wasn't very maneuverable on flat terrain.The 50th �May Day'' parade carried armored vehicles of the Stariom 29 and 100 km/h with the 75 mm 152 mm gun: It carried only one vehicle, under the command of Stashchokhov.

## STRYKER

The Stryker armored vehicle was manufactured from a late 1944 German term (armor Deutschland, baden, armored tank deradixert; solid tank deburredjäger, armored van deradixert; tank derfeldgetrachten, solid and bridden red 4 ton vehicles for ammunition], originally as a static armored vehicle model by Stuttgart. The Stryker was later adapted to a camo configuration for operational use. In a sunry extension to the original design (misted 2 1/2 by 3 1/2 in. The Stryker was developed at an approximate cost of 8 billion marks (dollars) and this cost was borne by the occupying armies of the Western Allies. The tank's maneuverability in battle has been widely admired for decades by tank- users and for several decades has been perceived to be superior to the German T-64 light tank, when it is observed that the armored tank can withstand considerably more direct fire and strike at high velocity. Its use on the Eastern Front, however, by the Islamic State as the TOW-II pickup truck, was criticized because of its ridiculously poor ammunition and against a much weaker enemy compared to American and Soviet tanks. The Stryker's ability to defend the army at will, combined with the devastating fire power of its 75mm gun, enabled it to saturate the enemy formations with it, allowing them to be either overwhelmed or dismounted. The Stryker tank has also appeared in various fictional films, novels, and television series.

## PERSUADER

The Persuader tank was originally developed in the early 20th century by George Bernard Shaw and subsequently published by Arsenal in 1939. After decades of testing, and with the assistance of the prototype M33, Shaw devised a pilot tank that was certified under license. It was developed in nine stages, and proved highly successful. The Persuader's ability to traverse and fire armor did not stop it from being a very devastating weapon, proving itself in many conflicts during the Cold War era. The Persuader has two 20mm cannons on each side, with eight 25mm for the main cannon, and eight 45mm for the sponson turret. The armor is covered by 25mm shells in combination with 29mm for the machine guns, 120mm for the rocket launchers, and 90mm for the low angle of fire machine gun. The armaments are clustered in four turrets. Notably, the main cannon can fire high caliber ammunition, as seen here.

## BIGER

The Biger armored vehicle is the standard procedure for defeating other offensive vehicles in areas with limited cover. It is often used for group combat and the like, and is capable of penetrating the armor of an enemy vehicle almost instantly. The tank lacks any turret and has 2 or 3 at the front and one or 2 at the sides. The tank's ability to penetrate armor is mostly maintained by armor penetration via the tracks. It is very durable, and hard to destroy. The Biger has relatively good top speed, and can withstand enemy fire for longer than most other Tanks. The tank can survive gunfire and grenades as well as concentrated fire and artillery fire, although damage was minimal due to the protection provided by its good and strong hull and to the fact that it can survive tanks within the lethal range of anti-armor grenade launchers or as near to the top as possible.The Bigger becomes more effective when equipped with Laser.

## HURRICANE

The Hurricane tank was a multipurpose craft in the shape of a gargoyle. The Hurricane's speed, range, accuracy and armament were much higher than those of the standard Korean armored vehicles such as the Hydras and Panther, as well as that of the Americans' vehicles such as the Sherman Firefly and the Freedom Heavy tank. According to the document, the Hurricane was designed to fight against any kind of terrestrial enemy, although it never served its purpose. Its appearance was inspired by contemporary aspects of Korean culture and the Hydras. It has an armored armour section with hardened steel spindles. This design presented a thick plate, even over the grille and that of the armored turret as it bulged towards the side of the craft. The tank was less effective when held at a certain distance. The Hurricane is often confused with the turtlelike Hydras, as it does not appear to be fast enough to intercept an incoming Jenner missile attack from behind.

## ORPHAN TANK MKIII

The Orphan Tank MkIII armored vehicle was available on the May 2016 Back to Basics (BRT) update in Russia as a well as on May 3rd, 2016 (via JPN news). The tank can also be used as a second tier character in Fast and Furious 6. The armaments are more focused on defensive weaponry than offensive ones, whereas the intended armor rating is higher for elite classes such as the Raiders. The tank's size is slightly larger than the other land armored vehicles, however, as well as giving it access to its most effective attack systems. The Orphan Tank MkIII lacks the commander class character benefits of the BRT-equipped Phalanx Armored Resupply, but can counter the Short-Range Gun System due to its size and combined length of 30 cm. This design provides ample protection to the tank's protection systems. To complete the SMH preview, check out a sneak peek of an Orphan Tank MkIII, Stampede.

## MILKSHAKE

The Milkshake tank is the largest and heaviest tank in the tank inventory. The Milkshake was designed to bypass speed bumps and assault terrains. The tank was brought into service in the year 2071 in the nations of General Hamner and Ovett. The tank is listed as the 25th upgrade to the tank. Its speed was increased to 75 km/h with the last increase seen in 2086, it gained armor and now it gains a crew of nine. The armaments are built around two main, anti-personnel rockets and a large IFV. The armor works extremely well, and its armor penetration accuracy can reach 1.5 meters. The Milkshake lacks a way to turn around the crews.

## ROSUGRUZZAN

The Rosugruzzan tank is based on many Israeli vehicles. The tank is considered to be one of the best in the world, the designers did everything to ensure that the tank looks fresh and ultra high quality, such as importing the exhaust covers from Italy or Guderian had to create a jacket around the tracks by the US based paint company World Rust. The Rosugruzzan tank was conceived as a low cost option in Israel and that's why this tank was mainly used on its military training scenarios. This design was never shared with other countries. The armaments are significantly inferior to the Israeli AMX IFV: The armor of the AMX var. The Rosugruzzan tank lacks in its range as well as its armor for mobility. The tank's appearance and commander was practically made by Stanley Sniffenmeyer. The Rosugruzzan tank was first produced in 1948, that's in fact the year that the Unit 8200 prototype was rolled out in the field by Royal Dutch Shell, where the tank was revealed to the public.

## LORD WILL

The Lord Will tank is located at the riverbanks of Curia and is considered to be the world's only truly formidable tank. The Lord Will tank is incredibly heavy and extremely durable. The Lord Will is known to never give up and does not begrudge anyone who kills it or it's crew. The Lord Will is considered by many to be more importantly a tank than a man. The engine is one of its many attributes. The tanks running on its tank-mounted engine with the ancillary diesel generators.

## LANDEUTSCHLAND

The Landeutschland armored vehicle was introduced in the 14th century. The Landeutschland tank was developed from the Baroness Ruhling Wolf armored truck. The tank is often mistakenly referred to as a German armored vehicle; this has also become a common usage of the title, often referring to German armor. Its primary purpose was to provide protection for the Army when acting against the Boers at Namibia. The Landeutschland's ability to hold its own against small arms fire was enhanced by its protection against dismounted antitank guns and his supporting forces. The Landeutschland tank lacks any ammunition and may only be unlocked during the Tank Fighter Pack quest. It is known to be mounted in vertical (middle) position.

## PARKER BINTE

The Parker Binte armored vehicle is one of the main enemy vehicles in ALIVE, since it can be traded for a target itself from the yellow market crate. Notably, it has a 25% chance to drop a Samson-type Heavy Support, which can be deployed with TOW/Full Auto by default. Its size is 1.29M Type 69, 3 kilograms when not equipped with 10mm suppressors, with a weight of 2.24 kg when equipped with 10mm suppressors and 4.67kg when equipped with 10mm suppressors. The Parker Binte tank was developed during World War II by the Tank-Mini Martech Company during the Early and Middle Periods. The tank's ability to carry and shoot high-explosive rounds is remarkable due to its comparatively light weight, 1.25 kg when not equipped with 10mm suppressors, and no recoil at all. Historically, a target in the center of the tank can be shielded by raising up an SMG turret above the lower edge of the target and to up to 2 meters from below, while the soldiers can still get into trouble during this attack (except on HEAT rounds).

## T-72B

The T-72B armored vehicle is a battlefield intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance vehicle which is an iconic and battle-ready vehicle. Its size and weight enable it to carry a variety of skills and capabilities, including a tactical reconnaissance system. It was designed in the Soviet period, primarily as an experimental vehicle to test the defensive system with and as a scientific experimentation. It was subsequently upgraded to the T-90 model in the 1990s. Its maneuverability, and ability to adapt to new threats and conditions makes it a worthy tank for fighting with terrorists, soldiers protecting frontiers and for long war. The armor bears many clues to the T-72B army service, even surviving in a previously inhabited environment.

## SOBER

The Sober tank was a publically distributed delivery vehicle to military units for armed escort and air reconnaissance purposes. It was extensively and successfully developed with military and civil units and later implemented by civilian/industrial units. The armaments for the tank were a 44mm machine gun on the front, and a 12.7mm machine gun on the turret. Its size and design of computerized monitoring system allowed tankers to report status from any distance. The Sober tank also carried a rifle on top of its rear vehicle for pistols as it was also portable. The armor made it difficult for groups of armored vehicles to maneuver when coming to a close to such armored vehicles and thereby's hindered their maneuvering ability and eliminated the stealth capabilities of vehicles that could hit enemies with higher speed. The Sober's speed and agility was especially praised by the US. The tank's maneuverability was improved by means of its angled shell ends and opposed front armor, which also assisted it in moving quickly and using its front armor to obstruct enemy fire.

## SHILOH

The Shiloh tank is a proud competitor in its country of origin, where it has established itself as a permanent war machine. Its speed and maneuverability make it a formidable foe. The engine gives it the staggering capability of completing at least three tank runs in four seconds. The Shiloh tank has undergone many changes over the years, including a new design language. This page provides quick reference. Parts and accessories generally take up very little space in your Shiloh tank, although the Zana tank's lower volume requires a little less gearbox space. The Shiloh's appearance is based on the American M3A2 Abrams tank that was introduced in 1974.

## HAISHA

The Haisha armored vehicle is extremely durable and highly maneuverable with its twenty-four possible upgrade options, five guns, armor plating, the rocket launcher. Notably, the medium versions can only transport four standard weapons at one time, and the heavy versions can only transport six cannons at one time. The Haisha is known to have a wide variety of configurations including twin turrets, stabilizing platforms and even command vehicles. The Haisha was developed to replace the BrahMos ATGM. The Haisha tank has the largest turret base of any type, accompanied by eleven more cannons in the rear. The armor is light, with six tracks, thirty-five lines of armor piercing and sustained fire power. Historically, the Haisha armored vehicle has a much larger armor plating, 200% more armor protection than anything existing at the time. It's in service from 1990 to 1994 in Persian Gulf and is already very used.

## KHAO KUNG PU

The Khao Kung Pu tank was licensed by Transport Molders. The armaments consisted of a serial 9×19 cannon in a barrel up to 12.5 inches diameter. The tank was designed by Jian Hu (�Jieyi Liu) to carry a Tungsten‐based tank gun. The Khao Kung Pu was to be manufactured from 1974 until 1994 and also finished in serial 9×19mm. The tank's speed was a maximum of 40 km/h or 36 mph. The tank was developed in two versions, General Electric K-98, an armored personnel carrier and based on the PT‐82 diesel engine, and Lee-Chung and the Flying Lotus BR‐600 armored truck, a two-ton road vehicle. The tank has slightly unconventional back-mounted gun sponsons and was powered by a Double Two‐Axis Dynamometer rather than a typical system of seven to 12 lines of Diesel system, in contrast to the Soviet armored vehicles.

## MEGASTAR

The Megastar armored vehicle was developed in 1955. Historically, the tank was used as an artillery platform and reconnaissance vehicle; until a number of problems (mostly my fault), the tank was never used for assault or security operations. The Megastar tank has a welded exterior that provides protection against hazardous materials, and through the use of articulated joints the vehicle seems to offer greater mobility. It has quite a few smaller gun turrets and sponsons arranged on the front hull of the vehicle, but most parts are arranged behind the back hull. Notably, most of the machine gun housing is hidden beneath the back hull. The tank's speed and maneuverability are excellent and the tank also has great accuracy, although due to the lack of frontal armor, it is very vulnerable in close-combat situations.

## PH1 BULLTOP

The PH1 Bulltop armored vehicle is part of a weapons train. The PH1 Bulltop tank is known as the HEA-7 medium tank. The tank has a length of 215 feet long and is mainly used by the Kimura Army in their assault tanks. Its main armament is six 76mm guns that range up to 15 meters. No variable modes are available on the frontal hull armor. Main armor is of a heated plastic shell with armored spars, a steel plate and steel eyes that make up a shell like appearance. Shturm plates can be fitted. The PH1 Bulltop tank is often converted for live fire combat after deployment.

## SNOS-100

The SNOS-100 armored vehicle was developed by the USSR in the 1950s as an anti-submarine anti-ship platform. First used against eastern coast of Russia, the vehicle has been used in counter-provocation roles in the Russian Arctic and other areas of the strategic Russian northeast. The SNOS-100 tank was designated � Russian Submarine Without a Crew (YS-100). Historically, the SNOS-100 and its predecessor tank simulators were under the order of General Valery Moskalov, later to be the Prime Minister of the USSR. The SNOS-100's ability to disperse enemy forces and place them under intense artillery fire was a major source of Soviet victory in the Second World War. The armor can withstand gunfire from range even before enemy soldiers make contact with their armor. The tank was first developed as a counter-aircraft platform and later modified to tank and aircraft defense and anti-submarine role and worked on a number of major roles over the course of its life. Its maneuverability, armor and internal security required a further tank upgrade in the following years.

## PBVTS MLT

The PBVTS MLT armored vehicle was conceived on the principle of a vertical MBT to support the concept of a self-propelled armored tank. The PBVTS MLT is known to have been utilized in Afghanistan in July/August 2006. The armaments of the MLT were developed from selected Army/USMC MBT (Linebacker MBT) with variable caliber and basic armament. The tank's appearance is modeled on a roadblock armored vehicle and differs from the standard MBT. It was developed and field tested with an anti-personnel round. The MLT crew consists of commander, gunner, loader and driver.

## MJOLNIR

The Mjolnir tank was developed during the Stalker mission. The tank was adapted from the M8 tank and gained much better protection against psychoshaft agent weapons. The tank was upgraded with more powerful armor. It lacks optical camouflage and a single ventral sensor pod. In addition to its external ports and engine compartments, this configuration only features a single pair of front-mounted direct x9 fire support weapons. The tank is considered to be one of the best in the galaxy for anti-gravite propulsion.

## KRIG

The KRIG tank was designed by Katsuyuki Kuratsuka, a former member of the Japanese Imperial Army, and dedicated to protecting the ancient fortress of Kanda. The KRIG tank's armor is constructed from hardened steel armor plate composed of weakly phased welding gypsum or steel tungsten carbide composite material on both sides of the front hull plate. The KRIG tank is known for its large mobility compared to other tanks, consisting of a towed 45-mm cannon, a combined ammunition load of 847 tons, a 15-ton missile defense system, 10-ton air defense and platoon reinforcement. The KRIG is the only mobile antitank tank featured in the ArmA 2 map set. It was also featured in the KRIG trailer. The tank has a top speed of 27 kilometers per hour, and can cross rivers and oceans without trouble. Its maneuverability is greater than the VK 98, meaning it can maintain a maximum speed of 48 kilometers per hour even in dry conditions.

## FULL RIDGE

The Full Ridge armored vehicle was the World War 2 vehicle of the Soviet Union. The Full Ridge tank lacks any windshields or grilles and is composed of eight exterior treads and eight interior treads. The tank was given the designation 10, 11, and 12, and fitted with a recessed anti-armor weapon system on each side. It has a tracked armament of three T-55 heavy machine guns and 21 machine gun mortars (and one 76 mm gun). Notably, only the front of the vehicle has a spacer in the form of a spherical counterbalance system and is basically camouflaged at all times. The Full Ridge's size makes it only suitable for underground battlefields. The tank is considered one of the oldest tanks in existence.

## LIBERTY

The Liberty armored vehicle is a versatile combat vehicle that boasts elite facilities to grant its users tactical flexibility and accessibility. With an array of weapons and armor upgrades, it offers versatility across roles and demands of operations. It is often used in reconnaissance missions, assault operations, or tactical engagements. The tank was developed and built by Mercury Aerospace Inc., located in Oceanside, California. Notably, the Liberty tank was used by the Terran Colonial Defense Force (TCDF). The tank's appearance shows the trundling civilian grace that defines the Cybertronian tradition. Its ability to move, mount, and utilize multiple weapons and armor upgrades at a critical time is said to be due to it's design. It is considered for the Human National Army (HNAA) after a friend predicted that Cybertronians would engage the human nation with overwhelming force, due to the thousands of Human studies they have conducted on Earth and having saved untold lives.

## BIPOSTO

The Biposto tank is a 55 mm armor piercing tank; it is fitted with a 10 mm secondary cannon and has a deck of four T-shaped main guns and a gun turret on each side. The Biposto tank is similarly protected by four different belts, four arms in front of the armor plating, three in front of the turret, and two in front of the gun turret. Notably, the vehicle has large flat roof pads on the front, sides, and sides, as well as all of the underhood panels. The tank's ability to carry two personnel in the tank deck gives it excellent mobility and extra firepower. The Biposto tank is considered one of the finest tanks of its kind in the world. The Biposto tank has survived its history of wars.

## MADARSAVI-20

The Madarsavi-20 tank is equipped with an aluminum alloy hull with 700 tons (48 tons heavier than an average tank) reaching a speed of 50 km/h. It also features 40 mm of armor, armor piercing fragmentation and beam cannon. It was developed by the Islamic Republic of Iran in cooperation with the Russian Empire. The Madarsavi-20 was implemented in 1960. The Madarsavi-20's size makes it effective against enemy armor, armor-piercing ordnance, hull blast, and armor penetrating armor-piercing bombs. It is often used in today's U.S. helicopters. It has a maximum speed of 24 km/h and low top speed. The tank's ability to launch artillery strikes has also been proven in combat.

## SYMPHONIE ROUGE

The Symphonie Rouge tank was built by the sijin and now lives in storage at the tsugaya's garage, but was destroyed during Tsuutomino. During the Neji Wars, the lancer (and others) use it to carry out military missions. This design is updated to newer concepts (there's a reason it's called a tank...) or even just redesign concepts such as the Tiger tank, which incorporates many improvements over the Symphonie Rouge design but doesn't support aerial operations as much since the wheels and tracks are interchangeable. The armor is made of 518mm thick rubber plate. The Symphonie Rouge tank is powered by a 980HP main engine (after Motomachi escaped confinement with Motomachi to make a second attempt on Ochanoshima) and is capable of traveling at up to Mach 5 (1.2 mph) and at twice the speed of sound. Its ability to target has dropped down from 80/100% to 10/25% over the Symphonie's upper volume (i.e. Notably, you don't get as much capacity to cover as you did for the Symphonie either), but the engine is kept so powerful that it's the second most powerful gatling gun in the world. The Symphonie Rouge's speed can reach 150kph.

## LOT 4163-2-AN

The Lot 4163-2-AN armored vehicle is the fourth such U.S. tank. Historically, the armored vehicle of this type was employed by the U.S. Army in special operations, elite units, or in combat units that encountered these large and maneuverable vehicles with extreme valor. The equipment for this heavy tank includes a 37-mm main gun and two 20-mm cannon, along with a radio and 20 mm machine gun, as well as armor and heat shield. The armaments included twelve 20-mm machine guns. The tank's size may vary slightly from that of the standard tank. The Lot 4163-2-AN tank has a crew of seven. It was considered by the German Army as a perfect direct support and fast-moving tank that could have easily carried combat troops on high ground. It has a 56-mm crew, including 1 commander, two gunners, and 2 tank drivers, and an armor thickness of 82 mm.

## GAERERIER

The Gaererier tank was the first part of the Vardan Regiments and later designed by the Terran Army, to offer support to space pirates who steal space-ship cores. Its maneuverability and combat efficiency enabled the Tsyrton Irrigation Corps to successfully fight against the ancient Tash-Trax throughout the 19th century. The tank's hull is completely reinforced, its top armor covering all sides of the armored turret. Its ability to camouflage itself and enter the atmosphere allows the platoons to further improve its camouflage. With its large armor class and large secondary cannons, the Gaererier is able to lay waste to obstacles with ease and cover some distance in shadow. This design has since become a standard vehicle of the High Command of the Terran Empire. The armor is generally rust-proof and its rotational effect can camouflage it. The tank's size allows it to perform specialized offensive and defensive tasks such as rescuing watercraft stranded by earthquakes, defending indigenous waterways, and defusing explosives.

## FLICKTURM

The Flickturm armored vehicle is a tank from Prey's crew. Notably, the design and description for the Flickturm is identical to that of the similarly-named, Musket (M95) and the StuG (StuG Tankbomber) from the Codename:IDX. The Flickturm was added with Gunslugs: Armored Destroyer and seen in the Sandbox for Goliath, a free DLC pack containing Battlefield 3 and Team Deathmatch. The Flickturm tank is known for its ability to destroy APC, Light Tanks and even light IFVs. Its defining feature is its 30mm turret that creates a bullet-like profile similar to a human bullet. The Flickturm tank has the capability to survive even indirect shell impact. For this reason it is considered a heavy tank.

## PANCHO VILLA III

The Pancho Villa III armored vehicle is the world's largest armored personnel carrier and serves as a museum piece. Its ability to withstand tremendous threat coupled with its limited size and adaptability as a shield allows it to be easily defended for transportation. Historically, the armored vehicle has represented a vital defensive element for the empire throughout its history. The tank's speed and huge capabilities make it ideal for battle, providing information quickly and strategically in times of overwhelming enemy strength. Notably, the vehicle's ability to accept all incoming tank fire in spite of armored armor allows it to provide peace-of-mind for all members of the tactical team. The Pancho Villa III - class armor system features extensive replacement part development and simulation development into armored vehicle. The tank is considered the backbone of modern fighting forces and has proven its formidable abilities against modern threats.

## GRIPTUTOR

The GripTutor tank is a variant of the Grad Auto. Like it's mobile counterpart, the GripTutor is equipped with slightly more advanced powerplants and weapon combinations that make it one of the heaviest tanks available. The GripTutor tank is also capable of carrying many payloads. The GriTutor series tank has a highly sophisticated energy and cooling system with a set of automatic methods. The GriTutor is designed to be accurate and also extremely stable and safe on the battlefield. The tank is considered to be an upgrade on its mobile counterpart and is preferred by the advanced military forces. The GripTutor tank was also introduced as the Preceptor, supporting the Spike program in terms of its high performance and armor against armored vehicles. It is known to be locked to the mass of the Raven.

## MARINE

The Marine armored vehicle was developed during the summer of 1963 with the intent of introducing the Marine Infantry into the battlefield, a truly lethal combat vehicle capable of taking on armored targets at a rapid rate. The tank's maneuverability and firepower allow it to engage in direct combat against maneuvering hostile vehicles, including infantry and vehicles of all types. The Marine tank lacks any armor protection and is also extremely vulnerable to enemy artillery fire. The Marine tank is often used in urban combat situations with battles, overt engagements, or concentrated pressure. Description of the Armored Mobile Object (AMO) 4x4 01 This is a description of the armored mobile object (AMO) 4x4. This design has been prototyped and does not provide a full description of the vehicle's performance.

## AUSAUSPIELSOHN

The Ausauspielsohn tank was a German branch of the Royal Tank Artillery, founded in April 1945, but successfully disbanded a year later. The Ausauspielsohn tank is considered to have been the most primitive and brutal manifestation of German armor production, employing primitive designs such as wheel tracks and vertical tubes, as opposed to early 6mm and 7mm T39's and the newer 0.40- and.50-calibre 8x114R34-Gpanzer regiment's KwK 44 L105/T73 heavy tanks. It has been known of for many years by several names including the 4MB-45 40mm mobile armor tank, Führerbatte 40, KwK 43 40mm mobile armor tank, and more recent models such as the 3MB-45 50 mm mobile armor tank and the 30MM-46 light mobile armor tank. The engine used in the armor was the same as that of the French Merlot or older single cylinder Denkut engine, and derived from the newer L46-1A50-5 system. The tank's drive train contained two prototypes, one on each side, designed for military combat. It is known to be several dozen meters long, approximately 14 meters wide, and eighteen meters tall. The Ausauspielsohn is often referred to as the pre-war Orco, but it actually differed significantly from that vehicle.

## TANK WERSEE

The Tank Wersee armored vehicle was produced by Viterbo. Notably, it is named after the position of its turret, the size of the turret, and the figure of its turret. Its components were alloyed from aluminum, magnesium, steel, or titanium. The Tank Wersee is a variant of the Rodan armored vehicle, which could be seen on the western front. The tank has several advantages, mainly it was built in Germany and assembled in Germany, which provides, as of this date, only a limited number of these vehicles in any mass production capacity. The tank lacks the guns of the Rodan which increase the mobility and prevents damage to the friendly forces of the surrounding area.

## TUBARAK

The Tubarak tank is a twin-engine heavy tank that is equipped with no.  The Tubarak's size has changed very little: to standard the tank is 1650 mm long and 250 mm wide in hull and 452 mm long and 166 mm wide in turret.The Tubarak tanks can load 11 at a time, however it cannot get to more than 20 shells in a row. The Tubarak's appearance is: It's immobile, so a side press-rod must be used on it to carry the heavy guns. Notably, the two rear guns are carried forward. It has to turn its arms to the side when firing. The Tubarak's speed is 30 km/h, although it goes at 35 km/h. The tank has two speeds - high and low.

## DESPERADO

The Desperado tank was once manufactured by Queen Faber and operated by the Sector Forces. Its appearance resembles a slayer's armored vehicle, sporting a heavily armored superstructure, power-generating amplifiers, and a twin C-1 Series Turret. The tank lacks dual secondary weapons, and lacks mounted armor. This design also allows the vehicles to sit atop of each other in space. Historically, the Desperado tank has achieved high efficiency, providing an average-to-high rate of fire and most skirmish support against their enemy. It is often considered as the best performing armored tank, however the reputation was not accurate, as the metal of its hull was brittle. Aside from its superior statistics, the Desperado is renowned for its low cost, and excellent armor efficiency, as evidenced by its combat efficiency being considered amongst the best.

## JULIANET

The Julianet armored vehicle is characterized by a large turret covering almost the entire hull. The armaments are 5x7MPL laser, 3x,88M98E53A2 machine gun, 3x,88M98E53A2 machine gun with 82-min. This design will make the incoming fire suitable for cover. The Julianet's appearance is typical for such attacks. It is known that any Julianet attack takes too long to be effective. The tank's ability to protect it's crew is also proven by the fact that the commander of Julianet Armored Regiment (Reinforcements 2nd and 3rd; KOR) is able to maintain his position with the help of the shields on top of the turret.

## SABRETOOTH

The Sabretooth armored vehicle is located in the beachhead of Nihleh-Ostalen with-out discernible presence. It was developed by the German Truckjagger AG using several SDT models for the foregun for use against armored vehicles. The tank's maneuverability comes from its versatility in utility - with new turret technology and 8 rear tank machine guns, this tank is a combat tank that excels in defenseless targets. The tank's speed and maneuverability make it a good choice for defense and offensive missions. The Sabretooth's appearance is based on the original German T85. The tank's combat capability has significantly changed since the time of H.G.

## SURVANT

The Survant armored vehicle is featured on the Vietnam War era combat vehicles built by Para in 1971. The tank is among several tanks that predate the First Gulf War with numerous modifications to its defense system. The tank was developed by a military unit under the command of the Armored Vehicle Company. The Survant was mass produced by Para Industries after the construction of the Arme Fatales in 1988. Its size during Vietnam War was 13 meters long and 22 meters in width. Its speed of 30 meters per second is the greatest armored vehicle of Vietnam War era.

## EQUIPE ANIMAL

The Equipe Animal armored vehicle is used by members of the Eighth Division and the Ghouls and Ghouls infestation. The tank is often created to be the permanent replacement for the armored tank. Its five tank guns allow it to damage other infantry forces without too much damage to itself, however the war machine lacks powerful weapons such as cannon which would knock aside or kill multiple enemies. The tank has powerful armor that is difficult to damage through and may be destroyed if a friendly fires upon it. The tank can easily destroy medium sized enemies when its gunfire reaches them; it can also counter your powerful anti infantry attacks. The Equipe Animal tank was initially released on September 20th, 2017 as a KORD Special in order to encourage those who owned WarGaming KOTOR III to get it.

## SENTINEL 1000

The Sentinel 1000 armored vehicle was a prototype tank of the Armored Support Units (ASU). It has a shell hardness of 105, effective armor of 250mm, the primary weapons are an AT grenade launcher and a 3-man M79 grenade launcher. Notably, there is no MP40 or MP9 weapon attachment. The Sentinel 1000 was similar to most 2×2 ATV models in that it did not use camouflage. The armor protection was not worth its weight in metal. Unlike most Russian armament, there was no spare magazine available with the Sentinel 1000. The tank is considered the Soviet standard in armored vehicles for several decades after its introduction.

## DIMENSION 4

The DIMENSION 4 armored vehicle is employed by the Marine Corps. Its appearance is mainly based on that of the Armored Forward-Sniper Vehicle (AFV). The armaments of the vehicle include a large 30mm autocannon mounted on the driver, a machine gun on the turret, a large caliber grenade launcher in the rear and a 24-tube carbine-armed 30mm cannon on the driver's right hand. The tank's ability to fire correct 10mm rounds is a key advantage, and has given the DIMENSION 4 an edge over other similarly armored US Army vehicles. It is often dubbed the George Patton Tank since it is more than 3 meters long and has a girth of over 1.8 meters. Unlike the other armored fighting vehicles in the series, the M4A1 Abrams, the DIMENSION 4 is usually left at the ready at any time, yet requires one person to operate it, subjecting the crew to the same fatigue and trauma that soldiers on both the American and Allied sides are subject to.

## SUZAK

The SUZAK armored vehicle was produced in the year 1987 and came in three variations, a 250 hp, 165 hp and 325 hp version. The designation SUZAK-30 was already used for the Guderian version of the model, but now appeared as SUZAK-30B. The SUZAK tank was developed by the USSR, but eventually sold to China. The tank is considered a milestone in Soviet weaponry development and is considered to be still popular and reliable in some parts of the world. Its wide frontal area and superior track design would improve its driving ability. It is equipped with two 203 mm (6 in) machine guns in front, with the Machine-Gun Regiment 312 (Movitheskoye 265) under the chin.

## BARSCA BILBAO

The Barsca Bilbao armored vehicle was developed in Zelo Carreira (known as the Standard Mobilization camp) as an infantry tank. The Barsca Bilbao tank is considered to be the perfect infantry combat vehicle for regular service troops in low-cost troop transport operations and mobility since it provides high capabilities of fire control and armor penetration by infantry. The engine of the Barsca Bilbao engine is Cummins Hex V-10. The tank's main armament is a 7.62mm round and a 120mm howitzer. It is armed with a number of 122mm howitzers. This design is virtually armored and cover maneuverable with minimum hit points of 80-120. The Barsca Bilbao was developed with a long-range heavy gun. The Barsca Bilbao's speed is estimated to be up to 5 m/sec.

## WALTHER G

The Walther G armored vehicle is an evolution of the earlier World War II model as used by tank soldiers, armored vehicles like the Tri-M1A and its primary functions are logistics, heavy duty defense, and expeditionary troop transport. The tank has numerous design variations, yet all are simple, elegant, and elegant-looking and it therefore has great comfort and mobility capabilities. The ATGM tank has a rectangular-shaped cylindrical shell with an articulated forward turret and armored front panel that controls various sensor functions such as track fire control systems, fire detection and tracking, road surface vision, and other functions with the radio towers of the vehicle. The Walther G tank is considered a separate compartment and unique and simple to operate due to its simplicity and simplicity in appearances, but also due to the fact that it has its very own integrated cabin to replace the heavier tank commander's cabin that came standard in the older T36 series. Its beautiful and smooth fuselage and only some minor system changes from the older tank still creates a tank at ease. The tank in the full size model does not have any weapons of its own aside from weapons and a bomb scoop that produces a far-out anti-aircraft surprise blast that needs to be triggered manually. Only when the bomb is planted into its target must the higher caliber cannon guided projectiles be fired to accomplish its task. The Walther G tank has a range of 40 kilometers and can transport 600 people at a time during construction to the frontline without breaking down (there is a huge release of gas inside the tank though) although the battle would take much longer since the gas storage coolant also has to be removed, so this terrain speed is important when using this advanced tank.

## M1 ABRAMS

The M1 Abrams tank was designed by Merle Erskine, Coq, in 1944. The tank was entered service in September 1944, where it served as an officer's vehicle. The M1 Abrams tank is considered a prototype by the following after-war tests: ``The tank was designed by Coq to give a range of target troops from 120 to 400 kilometers. The armaments were light and had no armor. It has 23 U.S. P-35 cannon mounted on two tracks to fire 20mm machine gun rounds that would be effective against light armor. The tank has an area of 8 acres (2.8 ha), 20-in (50 cm) broadside, and 25-in (55 cm) sloped. The M1 Abrams was produced for the Army of the United States of America. The tank was developed in preparation for Armored Motor Carriers in the mass production of tanks and light infantry fighting vehicles.

## KANG-1

The Kang-1 armored vehicle was one of the first vehicles fielded in Great War by the Allied Expeditionary Force. A technologically advanced Soviet-designed light tank, the Kang-1 was essentially a light towed artillery piece that could take fire without causing damage. The armor plating is made of high-grade steel which allows it to withstand almost anything thrown at it. The tank lacks long range weaponry and it has a slow speed, however these disadvantages were negligible as it had low hit points due to its state-of-the-art combat tank systems. The Kang-1's speed was practically on par with a Leopard 2 or a T-72 and its damage was nothing short of fearsome. Although heavy, the tank also had a good loadout of infantrymen, armor specialists, repairmen, and repair support vehicles, making the tank well equipped for battle.

## SUKHOI SU-27 MK

The Sukhoi SU-27 MK armored vehicle was modified for combat in Vietnam during the Second World War, when the Soviets invested heavily in their own tanks to outpace the Germans in terms of capabilities and tactics. The engine could be upgraded to carry nuclear, hydrogen or nuke-powered engines, to provide 24mm machine guns and automatic weapons, and the vehicle was designed to carry several thousand kilograms of ammunition. It was the second most powerful armored vehicle of the Second World War, its prime advantage being firepower and speed. The Su-27 took off from Sukhoi Land in June of 1944, while the Russians maintained a separate airbase at Khang Mong by the rivers near Seoul. The Sukhoi SU-27 MK was shown before falling apart while carrying the most advanced Soviet weapons and equipment. The armaments of the vehicle included:. Its size allowed the bomber to climb close to the ground to build up a charge of penetration for decisive attack. Its speed allowed it to circle rapidly, leaving a path behind it.

## OLD NORAGON

The Old Noragon tank is a small tank specifically designed for the famous German anti-tank mines used during World War II. The tank's ability to withstand precision blows to it's frontal armor plates makes it absolutely devastating. The Old Noragon tank is considered a sacred gift to both Russia and Japan since it was in possession of the legendary Luftwaffe Badger E turret line. The armor of the armor module at the front has been strengthened to resist multiple impact from enemy SMGs and heavy machine gun. The old Noragon's driver placed high priority on safety and was motivated by two reasons. The engine caused numerous accidents, including a plethora of fires in which only 17% of crew members survived. One was of one of his tank crews when his father took out a 12cm cannon behind him, causing him the same blast which caused his father's death. The tank has more than 400 additional modules in its armor module, making it the most resilient tank in its class.

## ALPINE RHINO

The Alpine Rhino armored vehicle was developed by Leaseco Incorporated, a California-based global construction company specialized in military tanks. The Alpine Rhino tank was designed to become the world's primary armored warfare vehicle. The Alpine Rhino was recently commissioned into service with U.S. Special Forces. It is the successor of the Leopard 2, the predecessor of the Leopard 1 and Panther. The Alpine Rhino integrates advanced computational intelligence, featuring intelligent processing in features, radar, laser, imaging, sensors, robotics, and shields to defeat the toughest foes. This design allows for greater flexibility in maneuverability, but also contains redundancies such as regenerative braking, combined ramming and power projection to protect the crew and its weapons. It is often housed within a four-person crew, with an operator performing duties of transporting goods, building and transporting supplies, and combat and reconnaissance duties. The Alpine Rhino tank is known for its forward mounted machine gun (MMG), rocket launcher, and CH-46 Chinook helicopter.

## NOZDUZ

The Nozduz tank was first developed in February 1942 by Soviet scientist and engineer Verniia Rogoisky. Historically, Rogoisky conceived of the Nozduz armored tank in cooperation with military strategist Arnold Dornberger (FATHER OF ACHIEVEMENT). By creating a simplified design for the car, the Soviet defense force evolved into the greatest tank superpower in history. Notably, that same tank was also the first to make the transition from a projectile weapon to a diesel vehicle. The tank's appearance was certainly different from other Soviet armored tanks. The engine was an air-cooled 4-stroke diesel engine, power system was set aside for five-wheel drive, radiator was considered a top machine and automatic headlights were built into the side windows. In all, this vehicle has 5,640 hp, it ran NIIF Panzerkampfwagen III variant with 2A16 50 mm gun and the 4 wheels at 2,688 h. Starting project began in September 1942, its commissioning, engineering and combat trials took place from June 1943 through December 1943 in Soviet command, Pskov on December 19, 1943.

## EBEL

The Ebel armored vehicle is a fully-stabilized armored truck only... uhm... known as Ebel in the sources. The armor features T5-1. The armaments consist of T51 DT100 heavy machine guns and T6B Phalanx automatic rifle, the latter being the upgraded T7B Phalanx rifle variant of the T51 used in current Russian AMX24 platforms. Its ability to penetrate enemy armor is comparable to the T59 and even the T59E1, which has moved up to better armor qualities of the T6B. Notably, it has faster fire rate and less volume compared to the previous Ebel, and can out maneuver its enemies. The vehicle also has improved turret and armor to prevent enemy engines from being destroyed by the vehicle's turrets and blast shields. It is known to be pretty good in combat itself, where the engine can be saved for enemy battles to allow it to run faster and is also capable of moving faster. It is considered by some to be better than the T60 D637F from around 2013 as it has been shown to be superior to other Russian tank based designs, including the T60A and M60K, and up against light tanks like the T52 MT01.

## NARUTSU

The Narutsu armored vehicle was once the top choice for civilian use by an extensive education wing of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications. By removing the armored vision lens, the Suomi was able to use these older records as a resource to prepare for New World usage. The tank was utilized mainly for operations between colonial regions and certain nation alliances. This design was delayed by over 2 months due to high maintenance demands, resulting in that the Suomi was infrequently repaired during its lifetime. The Narutsu's maneuverability in close combat allows it to gain the upper hand in a boarding action in force with other armorers, although it takes more maneuvering to avoid unnecessary collateral damage during fighting. A work-around is to attack in close with a large number of Ishida Bombers. The Narutsu tank is often seen serving as a sight to mid-range firepower and raked movement in conjunction with not supporting normal infantry protection assignments. Historically, it has suffered from a poor tank size and poorly placed armor for years, which resulted in significant damage in combat for those equipped with it.

## HANZER

The Hanzer armored vehicle was more of a light tank than an armored tank. Its hull design was quite basic in the sense that the driver usually had to get underneath and feed the armor crew. Its price-point was determined through equipment market indexes and a subject for research. The tank was especially popular in Nazi Germany due to the appearance of its tanks-mounted machine guns. It has been a favourite of some nobles as well, particularly in their army circles. The armaments were exclusively anti-aircraft and anti-tank weapons; the low elevation permitted concentrated firing of weapons and ammunition on its side (m3ap), which would block the sky while firing heavily. The armor was relatively low protection against high damage delivered by weapons and armor, due to high-rate of fire. The tank was also able to engage the infantry through its twin turret fire.

## FERDINAND

The Ferdinand armored vehicle is constructed with many of the former combat qualities of the South Korean armored cars that are used in the South Korean Armed Forces, where their rigid and rugged construction stands in stark contrast to much softer, flak armored vehicles, such as the armored personnel carrier (APC). It has two main gearboxes, with an external fire control unit (EFU) mounted on the tracks, with a secondary gearbox mounted on the top of the turret that serves as an explosive charge main tank ammunition system. The Ferdinand was first introduced in 1994 and was a very successful military vehicle and saw extensive use in the Korean Army for several years, during which time they have had near total success during single-vehicle patrols. The Ferdinand tank was designed as the primary road body protection for surface vehicles like tanks, and was meant to operate in heavy rains, mud, and snow during heavy losses of personnel or by providing enough armor for sustained manouevres in this wet conditions. The Ferdinand's ability to survive the resounding impact of M-60-barrel artillery from the 125 mm gun proved a necessity when operating in rainy conditions, but also caused numerous issues. The armor at the gun was only 225 mm thick, and the turret was of the weak built standard armor, as did most other of the hull types that it was fitted to. The Ferdinand is often characterized as being one of the most armored military vehicles of its type, having survived bombing, several demilitarization missions, earthquakes, exposure to heavy shelling, and the hands of commandos. This design allowed the vehicle to be mobile, be equipped with secondary firepower for troops doing relatively basic operations, and provide protection from improvised explosive devices (IEDs) which weren't lethal.

## KONKEY

The Konkey armored vehicle was introduced into the United States military after NATO forces in Georgia forced Turkey to invade the country. At the time, Georgia was friendly to the United States and been constructing Soviet-era tanks that looked similar to what the Americans had built at home. Its main goal was to defend the Russian Orthodox Church from Nazism, and it was found very effective. The engine of this vehicle is an Allison V-10 engine that powers the tank's basic functions while adding several specific upgrades that make the vehicle extremely powerful. The Konkey's appearance features a very recognizable gold-tinted interior, a camouflage pattern, and distinctive flash lights. The Konkey tank was first deployed in 1975.

## CERBERUS

The Cerberus tank is, as seen from afar, another speedblaster, constructed with either silonating tapered rectangular fissures or steel lath (rumbleproof). It functions just like the Cerberus, but the equipment is more geared towards long distance combat: the amount of heavy firepower and armor given makes it hardly any slower at war. With its armor getting quite thick, Cerberus has very little maneuverability. The Cerberus's size is quite low compared to the other Armus tanks (600mm hull, 110mm gun), but the hull top protection combined with its construction makes it very effective for firing on poorly defended areas. Cerberus follows the ways of the Armored Tank (rethelled armor) world, i.e., shellproof and has slim weight. The armaments of Cerberus are equivalent to those of the medium tank 082K, but somewhat different.

## RHINO

The Rhino tank was modeled after a 30mm IFV (interchangeable between regular and armored) that was fielded in World War II. The tank was utilized for training purposes and for marching and chasing armed insurgents in areas occupied by Allied forces. The Rhino's versatility in service enabled it to be quickly upgraded and well resupplied throughout the war. The Rhino is the first tank to feature a diesel engine. Rhino tank Specifications The Rhino tank is lightly armed with 3 x 12.7mm L/50 machine guns: 7 x 7.62mm, 8 x 8mm, 4 x 12.7mm L/50(RR), 6 x 6mm, 4 x 12.7mm(RR), 1 x 7.62mm, 1 x 9.4mm, 1 x 7.62mm(RR). The Rhino is considered by many as one of the more effective heavily armored infantry tanks of World War II. The Rhino's ability to conduct long range attacks enhanced with the lighting and maneuverability of its iconic armored quad tracks allowed it to engage against infantry, tanks, and troops alike, even against lightly armored units. It is often seen flanking military units, or even guarding front lines as enemy units slip into position to attack.

## MARIBYRNONG

The Maribyrnong armored vehicle is a very fast and mobile tank that allows TIVB-85 to reach high mobility targets with zero risk of unexpected losses. Historically, Maribyrnong tanks were fielded on any terrain outside of combat zones (except jungle) and entered service on or around 7 June, 02542. The Maribyrnong tank is considered one of the best infantry fighters of the TIVB-85 line. The Maribyrnong's size and maneuverability make it effective at a range of 80 kilometers (50 miles) on a direct hit. The tank was developed during the late 1950s as an upgraded light tank that could handle various roles (such as camping in the underground system and defending the ATMs of other TIVB-85 teams) and successfully assisted in a number of key missions. It has also been used in several Desert Bus assaults and other urban operations by all members of the TIVB-85 command. The Maribyrnong was adopted by the TIVB-85 command in its first task force in March, 29011.

## RENEWAL

The Renewal tank is an armored triple Rex with excellent job scaling. The Renewal tank is often used against mechanized units in PvE; it's recommended to reduce its armor grade to near its median, with only a single layer of armor to defend against close-quarters. Historically, the armor grade on the Renewal tank dropped to +5. The armor on the Armored Triple Rex decreased from 6 to 3 over time, increasing its firepower. The Renewal has decent health, but its maximum health should never be increased above 1. The Anti-Materiel Armored Triple Rex has the highest combat bonus to armor and survivability, leaving no room for the rest of its points. This design should only be used in PvE situations where it is impossible to provide superior cover. The engine is in the same condition as a standard Rex, and was modified to give it 200 speed, instead of 300.

## NIGHTMARE

The Nightmare tank was a single-person war machine that was armed with a single machine gun. It was never used. It was the last tank of the Chinese Army. Historically, the engine was a modified Hanjet-Hai-Khakdan engine that was designed in a submarine. The engine was acquired from the Chinese in 1942 by the U.S. Pacific Operations Command. The Nightmare is often referred to as a scrap tank due to its condition.

## MOBILITY WARRIOR

The Mobility Warrior tank was developed by Veritech Military Industries in response to standard vehicle shortcomings. The Mobility Warrior's appearance was altered to improve maneuverability and capability. Historically, the Mobility Warrior was used for assault roles in battles such as kamikaze attacks, infiltration, and confrontation with an enemy. While the agile mobility of the Mobility Warrior greatly improved its mobility with none of the drawbacks of more conventional vehicles such as tanks or trucks, it still left its weaknesses unaddressed. Its speed and mobility was compromised in many ways, including the lack of a hyper speed reduction device. It has been called a major improvement over conventional vehicles with the improvement in velocity.

## CHOPPER

The Chopper armored vehicle is the best common vehicle for combat in VR. The lower shield module is connected to the armour via a bicubic rail. It comes with the armor and shield module, commander's console and supply items. The Chopper's maximum speed is approximately 15 km/h, though this speed is considered limited in reality due to the fact that turret placement and camera orientation will remain constant. It lacks the Headless Engine Adaptation and the Gauss Gas Launcher and Armoured Mobility System, but can deal double damage on the same character using its Dual Gun. The tank is considered super strong.

## ZUG ZING

The Zug Zing armored vehicle is an ideal addition to any upcoming theater of conflict. It has been designed for the ongoing military operations, air battles, and coastal fortification of the entire planet. The Zug Zing's appearance, however, does not fall under the common classification of vehicle. With its armored sides, the Zug Zing is just plain powerful - through continuous assault, coastal fortification, and aerial assault on enemy vehicles, its owner can endure the most intense environments on the planet. The Zug Zing tank is often used as an advance transport and as a combat vehicle. The Zug Zing comes equipped with a 20mm armor plate, light transmission, and rockets for solid surfaces.

## ARMORED ANTELOPE

The Armored Antelope tank was used during the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia and Czechoslovakia made the choice to adopt the vehicle as part of their war effort. The armaments of the Armored Antelope tank include: armoured ram that fires its armoured ram during the shooting phase and also has secondary effect with boosted artillery shell in the attack phase. The Armored Antelope tank has 250 mm howitzer and 300 mm howitzer turrets. It has a crew of eight. The armor of the Armored Antelope is made from steel. It is known that the turret can have two interlocking pits to be used.

## SHIRAYA

The Shiraya tank is a modular tank. The Shiraya has an armor hull (with exposed carbon and phosphorous composite armor) as well as a hull-mounted missile gun, whereas previous designs had two main guns. Its size and thickness are similar to that of the larger Amaray, it also has a 6 m traverse speed, crew mounted machine gun, 50mm traverse range and 25mm turret. Historically, the Shiraya was a key component of US armored vehicles. The Shiraya is known for being built under the supervision of the National Engineer Brigade in Japan, and can be converted to an American standard but this was modified during production. The tank's speed is 5.74 km/h, with crewed traverse of 54º at 30km/h. The armor on the Shiraya is built of coatings that provide protection for 11 mm penetration. Its appearance is similar to the modern American Abrams, some turret areas are less visible, but overall features the same linear design.

## SU-25E

The SU-25E armored vehicle was developed in Russian arms giant Makneftegaz between 1987 and 1988 as the lead development of the multirole fighting vehicle (the older Soviet Rostov-based SU-25BM). The SU-25 was the world's first multirole fighting vehicle, except for China and India and serves a global role in counter-insurgency operations (CAI) and counterinsurgency (COIN) operations. The SU-25E was released in 1991. The SU-25E tank was developed on the breakthrough of tank development by Makneftegaz under the direction of Vladimir Putin's tank unit CAZ T-34. The engine of the SU-25 was an engine designed by Siberian's Akimov and using the Benz 190 natural gas engine. Historically, the SU-25's main drawback is due to its moderately wide armor plating to that of the older Soviet-produced T-34. The tank is considered as a potential counter-terrorist platform as well as a potential strategic defensive vehicle.

## EVIL UNIT

The Evil Unit tank was an experimental military vehicle powered by military technology. The tank's size and design were described as equivalent to the legendary Hydra, Russian armored troop transport. The prototype military transporter was piloted by a human participant in this project who later sacrificed his life due to a health condition requiring treatment. The tank's speed was limited and it had extreme amounts of vibration and induced sickness, the mating ability of its engine only allowed it to emit intense bloodlust. This design was successful and has proven successful at all levels of service despite being more cumbersome than most tanks due to its very bulky design. The Evil Unit's maneuverability was incredible and it used large portions of the high pressure accumulator of a high voltage power pack which resembled a powered blood shower and was capable of returning the affected individuals to normalcy within about 30 minutes.

## MICROPHYLLIS

The MicroPhyllis armored vehicle is a human-only Mark II version of the Mobile Armored Vehicle Mark I. The armaments consist of: It has two 16-mm cannons, the front cannon being mounted under the turret, and the rear cannon being mounted on the right side of the hull. It lacks automatic reloading because of its crew's youth and inexperience, so every round has to be manually fired before it is expended. The turret mounted armor has gray armor-plating. Notably, in the opening cutscene, the ATV's treads are protected by twin 13-mm RPG-7 batteries. MicroPhyllis and MicroRey Exclamation Point vehicle article This is a description of the armored tank jeep Nailbiter : This armored vehicle is a moving, evasive type vehicle, and is very popular among you-two, you-thinks alike.

## NEUER ALLESSTAAT

The Neuer Allesstaat armored vehicle was developed in 1980 and based on the very popular KV50 armored personnel carrier. The engine of the KV50 is a Me 262 heavy turbine engine with a 230 hp crank, and a battery of up to 12 22 volt electric motors (with 3 2200 kW electric motors for better drivetrain performance). The armor of the tank is air reinforced. The Neuer Allesstaat tank was selected because of its standard protection of the vehicle, and because of its simplicity and accuracy. Notably, the vehicle is based on a car chassis of the Antonov An-4 gun truck. The Neuer Allesstaat tank was developed as a follow-up to the successful KV50 platform, and has become a major contender in the armed forces during its service life, especially because of the reduced environmental impact of the development.

## TIGER

The Tiger armored vehicle is mounted on the LRT vehicle. It has a troop compartment in the upper section, and two frontal machine gun turrets that can be mounted on the turret roof. The Tiger's speed is powerful enough to cripple incoming aircraft and is intended for low-angle air defense, but being slowed by a helicopter adds an extra kilometer of horizontal displacement and only makes the Tiger and its rotorcraft faster. Historically, the Tiger has relied upon the Leopard 2 C 2 in early production model to improve its abilities. It lacks the Leopard 2's increased accuracy due to production limitations, and lacks the Swift 2's excellent endurance and ability to cope with the increasing number of enemies it encounters. It was designed as an air defense and precision combat vehicle, meaning it can be repositioned by ground forces, making it quite valuable for responding to air attacks. The tank is often mounted on Ford's streetcars. The tank has five warhead ports, as well as a weapon carrying rack that can be carried onto the turret roof and locked inside the chassis.

## TOMOBITO

The Tomobito tank is quite a bulky tank, with an armored body, a rear windowspan of 550cm,. At first glance it looks complicated, but this armored tank does not require complicated protection. The tank was built by Industry and it has anti-infantry capabilities as well as tank hull upgrade. The armaments including 18x50mm AAA machine gun, 6-barrel machine gun, 25mm AA machine gun, anti-personnel grenade launcher, antiship surface-to-air missile system, flame thrower, 1:10 impact ordnance, 5-part roadster chassis, motorized crane, automatic turret, multiple weapons launcher. The Tomobito's size makes it very portable but this is the perfect tank for training on the road.It also has HEAT missile, it has homing missiles as well as various weapons, it can carry weapons outside of the tank and could be armed with Laser guided missile launchers as well as heatseeking missiles.The Tomobito's main upgrade is designed for upgrading and providing less armored protection than the regular tank. Hereafter it does not get any upgrades other than the initial one.

## SUPER LANCER

The Super Lancer armored vehicle is a large, well-armored multi-purpose vehicle that comes in many forms. The tank is known for its durability and destructive power, a trait in contrast to a more fragile turret or more maneuverable vehicle. The Super Lancer's construction was based on two designs. Historically, armor use on armored vehicles varied widely between heavy weapons use and observation mode of operation. The tank lacks weapons of conventional calibers, as its primary armament consists of mounted air and missiles that are also equipped on the turret. The Super Lancer's ability to operate in conjunction with both traditional and anti-armor munitions was considered an advantage and was accounted for in the design.

## HITLER

The Hitler armored vehicle is a vehicle designed for battle. The Hitler's size and exterior measures 98.8 meters by 105.1 meters, making it roughly comparable to the Israeli A4. The Hitler tank is considered extremely durable and accurate. The Hitler was designed to excel in close-quarters battles. Notably, unlike other armored vehicles, the German armored vehicles are protected from shelling by the bursting shells. The Hitler tank is also equipped with anti-aircraft artillery for ground battles against conventional enemy aircraft.

## TIGERTANK

The Tigertank armored vehicle is an example of advanced equipment, technology, technical achievement and lore - given in history lore by the survivors of the Great War. Now you can feel the power of this old world with it's new armor and weapons. Historically, vehicles were developed and purchased from countries in Europe, but they were not yet mass produced. They still remain a rarity in first-person shooters. It is unknown what led to the adoption of automobiles in the centuries since the 1920s. Its speed alone makes it useful in some circumstances, but well above ordinary motorized vehicles. It lacks the firepower and armor of tanks of the opposite time, the German tank with its 88 mm cannon.

## RHINO II

The Rhino II armored vehicle was the main production tank used by the Earth's military for many years. The Rhino II's speed and firepower proved to be dangerous and hard to deal with, and the small and fast Earth defense forces were unable to adequately deal with them. The tank is known by many names, including: Rhino, Epidemic, Defector, Krugerrigger, TBH; Rhino, Firedrakes, Grenadier, Walker, Defender; Scrambler, TreBreather; Paladin, SignaN, Bulwark, and also a variety of nicknames, including Rhino, Nail and Jet. Notably, the Rhino is a modified version of the PRG's Rhino. A variety of derivatives of the Rhino are available; the World Bosses, for example, receive numerous modifications such as engravings and modifications to the armor.With the introduction of the Rhino, the Nova and General Octavia tanks have come under some very sharp criticism of this tank. Nova Tanks are considerably larger than Nova Tanks with significantly more capabilities.

## STURMBAN

The Sturmban armored vehicle was created for skirmishes, against enemy aerial attack vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles. It utilizes a mud warhead, which is loaded with 18.7 kg of bombs and is called in black warhead. Its maneuverability is very high and the round shaped body gives these dangerous platforms a tremendous surface defense penetration. The engine is a top tier four stroke engine, 599 hp. Historically, the Sturmban medium tanks have been an almost more deadly version of light tanks, especially for enemy infantry and combat vehicles. The tank's speed and accuracy are extremely high, making it the hard opponent in terms of armor penetration. It was originally developed as part of a specific prototype of tactical tank that was based on a Panzer IV and appeared to only be for illustration purposes. More recently it was the prototype only of a whole series of vehicles that were developed as an application for the later George III.

## AIRRANGER

The AirRanger tank is a specialized tank for Ground Forces but comes into service for the combat air and antiaircraft ground forces. This design is specialized in combat roles of ground patrol, antiaircraft counter air, and anti-tank. It is often configured as an AT-AT chassis. The tank was designed primarily for Defense ITEM Vehicle Deployment (DITS). The engine is completely quiet until turned on. There is almost no noise when the front window and windows behind the driver seat are open. The tank is known for excellent protection against artillery shells. The chassis has 48 seats with maximum width of 120 cm.

## KASATSIN

The Kasatsin armored vehicle was a heavy armoured puddler-type tank manufactured by Karosta Design on the State of Kalyspe. Notably, the tank has the highest level of tier and significantly more perks in its tier than the tier-9k, period-numbered main battle tank of the modern Soviet Union. The Kasatsin's appearance is very similar to that of the RPG-7 variant of the T-34/85, in that the tank features complex composite frontal armor and a turret configuration which features a breech-loading, direct entry turret at front. Its speed and maneuverability are not very high compared to its main battle tank equivalent, the T-34/85, but if it can avoid being destroyed due to various shots, it can defeat these tanks very quickly. The Kasatsin's versatility is also matched by its tank caliber, having a total of 105mm of high-explosive penetration for its 10 rounds, the same as its main battle tank counterpart, the T-34/85. Although the Kasatsin tanks were originally intended for use in the volatile Eastern Front of World War II, this tank proved to be a very effective vehicle in the Eastern Front during the Cold War.

## S-WAAAGH

The S-WAAAGH armored vehicle was the ultimate ranged tank in its time. The armor was self-propelled and controlled by AA-73835 autocannon, which provided long-range fire power and the maximum firepower of 105mm howitzer, supported by 76mm Howitzer and/or 8-tube cannon from SL-40 Airstrike. Notably, the AEW tank didn't have an anti-aircraft or AMRAAM armament but opted for a plasma-driven APSR (Active Seeker System). The S-WAAAGH's ability to hunt almost 200 infantry vehicles at once resulted in major losses to infantry units and gunners alike. The SPAAG no longer carries the same turret mounted AA-73835. In fact, it was previously mentioned to the tank as having replaced the high performance version. The M20647548 crashed due to the stress of being used by enemy weapons crews in a massive battalion maneuver (along with a direct hit on its tires).

## KOTTAYAM

The Kottayam tank is the prototype for the Inner Mongolia Transports from India as well as the Indian National Transports. It was considered an innovative breakthrough in the antitank armored vehicle and the only armored vehicles intended for battle. Its size ranged from a single 6.2-ton truck to 12.2 tons, but it was provided with a significantly larger gun, higher capacity weapons modules and a new hull design. Notably, the tanks all had blue boxes on the doors and front ports. It is also notable that after the show ended, the ATBMs were dispatched into several firefights with armoured tanks of different nationality with different munitions. This design was not a blind imitation of any existing technology by either inventors or manufactures.

## SHRIKE

The Shrike armored vehicle is generally known as the Hellcat armored vehicle. The Shrike's size makes it useful in complex infiltration tasks and highly mobile units. The armor of the vehicle keeps it stationary during battle and will take hits very easily, as its body folds down under powerful shockwave of the rear armor. The Shrike tank is considered an armored conventional tank, not some winged tank. The armaments include an anti-armour laser, a medium anti-armor rocket launcher, and anti-tank missiles. Its ability to mount and deploy a big charge of missiles is advantageous in urban warfare where HEAT and MG both cannot penetrate. Notably, these weapons cannot be detached from the vehicle by the user.

## AAC-2TR

The AAC-2TR tank is about half the weight of its predecessor. Its speed is higher than that of a British Pz IV L/38, but the main reason for this is that it has much better armor. The AAC-2TR has 35 mm HVAP cannon on the top turret and 30 mm AP cannon on the rear. Its appearance is very similar to the Russian 77 mm FV304 as far as armor is concerned. The armaments on the armor tier are the same as in the M1A1 Abrams, with a 132 mm D-10 cannon, 64 mm MG 88 on the front, and 16 mm TANK-8 launcher on the side. The AAC-2TR's armor protection was improved with the use of enhanced high-tensile armor.

## MARKUS ZETA

The Markus Zeta tank was a major contribution to the winter warfare of World War II and the development of the German army. The tank's position in the German Reich was all-important because of its offensive value as well as a strategic battle advantage. It has a 31cm-gun with the anti-tank gun while other tank guns operated on what is called the advanced anti-tank field (AAT). It is often called the most powerful war tank of World War II. It has a 1,5 tons range of speed and up to 120 horsepower. The tank lacks armor except the Panzer armour plate.

## ZABRAK

The Zabrak armored vehicle is an ultra-light armored world vehicle for defense systems operations, capital transport, command and control, general and medical transport, and defense export. It is considered the latest of the German armored vehicles. Zabrak is offered as a 30 mm and 75 mm series with an upper frontal armour protection of 35mm. Historically, this tank was considered a complete blank cannon configuration with another variant capable of protection of armor from 40mm to 75mm. The armaments of the Zabrak are employed mainly in one of four variants: Rifle, Machine Gun, Combustible or Hydrophobic. The tank lacks independent traverse and high speed stability. In order to provide frontal support to Guderian battalions, German tank battalions must contribute to stand-off distance and engage offensive and defensive forces through mobility, supporting firepower, high speed and good maneuverability.

## FLINCH

The Flinch armored vehicle is a strong effective tank model with armor and other defensive attributes often unusual for a tank. The Flinch was first introduced in 1995 and was likely based on the Challenger tank design, perhaps an upgrade of the Challenger development model. It was developed in cooperation with Curacao's Curau Marine Technologies, released in 2000 and has been purchased by the French Federal Army which until today has remained independently operational. The Flinch tank is armored with 2x tier VIII anti-tank armor that is bordered by additional 7x armor plate that increases protection. The Flinch tank is often used by the Minutemen troops in Africa. The Flinch's maneuverability with infantry positions makes it very effective in ambush and quickly retreat while maintaining stealth.

## INTREPID

The Intrepid tank is a formidable vehicle which can be built in various versions. This design has an effective range of 12,600 meters (30,600 feet). The Intrepid was introduced into combat service in 2514. Unlike its smaller peers, the Intrepid will not take damage from enemy fires, meaning that it can exist as a stationary target. The Intrepid carries the standard Astromech 4A6 bipod, instead of the superior battle weapon with anti-personnel slots. The Intrepid tank will also be used as a mobile unit. It was developed as a replacement for the venerable EVA-6 Sentry turret.

## MAN OF WAR

The Man of War tank is an articulated turret that stands for the M3/MGML system of Armored Warfare that came out of Armored Warfare 3. It is similar to the Tier 10 armored vehicle, but used for mobility and long-distance combat situations. The M3 turret has two quick-reload locations, on either side of the hull, so you can use it to close on enemies. The Man of War is considered to be the strongest tank for infantry, but more powerful for close combat. The tank was designed to provide high mobility, with high armor and high gun firepower and is on the diagram as the tarmaxes and barrels of the Armored Warfare. It is known to be used by most APCs and to be highly durable in a fight.

## PANZERHEFT SEIBERT

The Panzerheft Seibert tank is used for changing gears. Notably, it is the most used vehicle by this point. It is known for being the fastest moving tank in its class; it's speed is higher than the best armored car by which it can be compared; and the amount of interior space it holds means it has more room than the average vehicle. The tank is self-propelled with a top speed of 35 kph and can be ordered into battle at 90 hp. Its tank hull is 3m high and weighs 14,000 kg. This design has a 19.6mm thick and 10.2mm thick frontal armor. The armor is stabilized by a front fin and side-sloped armor that protects the gun turret. The tank was developed by the Army Engineers Institute of Tank Design, looking to improve the Panzerhund.

## FOOLIN

The Foolin tank was a low-thrust, heavily armored vehicle originally deployed by the Galactic Republic. Its ability to stick to obstacles and weather changing weather caused by distant cosmic events led to its often-quoted name. The Foolin tank has been around since at least 26 BBY. The tank's appearance has been modified to appear more unique with armor modifications; typically sloped, with both wingtip and wingmesh panels altered to suppress ambient electromagnetic radiation. The Foolin's speed has also been modified to allow it to proceed faster and leave behind less damage while also increasing the size and speed of its tracks.... The Foolin was originally fielded by a Republic test unit in 23 BBY.

## KILLER KV-IV

The Killer KV-IV tank is armed with 8 (8) machine gun and 7 of it's 37 machine guns against aircraft. Its crew has the highest equipment score for unarmed combat. It is manufactured by Amamiya. The tank's ability to ram a truck is impressive for a standard tank. The Killer KV-IV tank has the highest armor level for armored tanks (115). It lacks this armor with difficulty level of 85.

## BRITISH DESIGN

The British design tank is incredibly durable. The British design tank is considered to be an all-rounding armor that completely protects the hull from direct hits, infantry and artillery. This design is similar to the American M2 (or the British 5.56mm) but with the addition of a 120mm caliber gun. The tank's maneuverability and good combat performance make it popular in classic NATO engagements. Armor plate (Shroud): To decrease enemy firepower, armor plate is equipped on the turret. The tank's size and firepower make the armor plate impossible to hit with its full strength. The armor shell blocks debris, provides additional protection, reduces tank penetration and greatly reduces the ship's velocity.

## HATOFUL BOYFRIEND

The Hatoful Boyfriend armored vehicle was a useful tank available in All Mentioned Upgrades. Notably, it became the model for a later model (along with its cousin). Its appearance in All Mentioned Upgrades is the art of Kevin McAllister. The tank lacks the armor unique to that model. It is said that it is a lesser variant of the Homeworld Grunt armored vehicle. It possesses the same looks and sounds as the standard Assault Defense equipment, but does have 2 health packs and support armaments that are alternate warhead shells. It is based on the Eris with two tracks instead of one. The Hatoful Boyfriend tank is often erroneously referred to as a Grunt tank, as they share the same color scheme and they both have green tanks at the rear instead of black ones.

## FLAMBOYANT

The Flamboyant tank is a platform of steel-reinforced concrete, and possesses an explosion ignition system. The Flamboyant is known for its extraordinary flexibility and remarkable mobility. Its turrets are powerful, capable of locking down enemies, or destroying them. The Flamboyant tank lacks any artillery technology of its own. It is also amphibious, allowing it to take off in the water. Its appearance depends on the weapon the Flamboyant is carrying. The Flamboyant tank is considered a heavy weapon, even for R2-D2.

## HEVP

The HEVP tank was developed by AEGIS, and released to Afghanistan during Operation Restore Hope (as part of Operation Technical Readiness) in May 2014. Its appearance is inspired by the American M1 Abrams tank. Note that the IS-741 has been replaced by this variant with larger gun. The first 3 AMS automatic machineguns of the tank are prominent, and its front half was lengthened by 18mm to facilitate easier elevation. Its ability to rapidly enter high terrain enables infantry to enjoy tough, smoke-free terrain, and is especially suitable for conditions such as Afghani Uruzgan terrain. The HEVP was capable of holding its own in the late-20th century assault role, and has been one of the main platforms of the Afghan army. The tank has remained unchanged since its manufacture. The tank's speed is identical to a standard tank, and can be easily operated in any weather.

## OZHAV

The Ozhav armored vehicle is a vehicle that is made using any non-null ammunition type, as long as the ammo type itself matches the structname. The Ozhav tank is considered armored if the armor thickness of the cockpit is less than or equal to 10 percent of the armor plate, or any other armor type such as armor firewalls, hull deflector plates, hull effects, or any other armor protection. The tank's appearance is determined by the armor thickness of the cockpit and the Type III visor turret. The engine is located in the rear and the operator must have the access license which allows them to operate in or within 1,000 meters of the armor surface. The Ozhav has a top speed of 20 km/h. As a result, the visibility of the cabin is much better than a normal vehicle. However, due to increased direct-entry bomb damage, the viewing area can take several extra minutes. The armor thickness of the cockpit (the edge of the pilot's torso area) and the Type III visor turret (the part of the armor above the driver's helmet area) can be examined with a standard sniper scope with a resolution of 12 cm (4 inches).

## PROJECT CONDOR

The Project Condor armored vehicle is defined as the first Ukrainian armored vehicle in production after World War II. The Project Condor's designers fully incorporated modern machine guns and guns found in the Luchs and BTR's under the arms to enhance both mobility and firepower to counter the formidable arms of the AK-47. The tank's maneuverability, hull protection, armor, and firepower are up to 100% of the Stryker Mk. The Project Condor is classified by the Command and General Staff of the Armed Forces as a medium-tanks armored vehicle. On paper, the Project Condor is considered a relatively safe asset, but real world, Chinese forces has already demonstrated with the Type-97 Tank Destroyer. Its ability to quickly transport multiple tanks under heavy enemy attack and complete missions with quick resources is unprecedented.

## LUCKY MAKE A MISTA

The LUCKY MAKE A MISTA tank was first introduced in 2281. The LUCKY MAKE A MISTA tank has the final edge in the LUCKY Make a MISTA category. Its origins date back to BattleTech III, with a crew of 25tors, at least one gun and a few mostly private modules and a chassis with big armor plating, so it stands out from the rest of the lineup. The LUCKY MAKE A MISTA tank's prototype entered service in 2297 in a prototype test called LUCKY MARCUS II, with the vision being to eventually replace AI ground units. The LUCKY MAKE A MISTA's maneuverability as a standard tank was deemed too low for combat, while its firepower was not. The LUCKY MAKE A MISTA's size made it a target for enemy infantry and AT Guns that lacked explosive weaponry.

## TANK FAVOR

The Tank FAVOR armored vehicle is more powerful than most tanks. The Tank FAVOR's speed, armor, and gun are more powerful than those of the largest Armored Fighting Vehicle. The Tank FAVOR's size also has several advantages. The Tank FAVOR tank is considered as dangerous as most large Armored Vehicles. The tank's maneuverability can increase by 10%. This design also allows for traveling through the air during battles.

## TANKBOMBER

The Tankbomber armored vehicle is a heavier version of the Shermans which makes a better use of its speed. The Tankbomber was heavily upgraded in the German-held area of Afghanistan; the new variant featured suspension driven wheels, armor plating, Kevlar fabric bed suspension, an enhanced cargo load capacity, lowered ballistic and thermal effects and significantly better penetration characteristics. The Tankbomber tank was considered to be one of the strongest of its type in the SAAAA armored vehicle organization. The Tankbomber tank is also easier to field than the other armored cars. The Tankbomber's size (between 23 & 46 tons) matches that of the StuG III 40 mm gun; the added utility of the Abrams 90 mm gun greatly helps in the tank's layout. The Tankbomber's speed also fits well with the other tank groups, as is proven by the tank's rather sharp reaching capabilities. One end of the StuG III 40 mm gun has an optimal range of 7,280 meters and has a muzzle velocity of 330 meters per second. Historically, the PzIV-I 2 wadner started with a 22cm tank gun and developed to a 20cm gun.

## BATMAN PREFECT

The Batman Prefect armored vehicle was the first auto-fuel tank that could attack large groups of enemies. The tank was developed by the Austrian State armored company, using a combination of German armored kits and pre-production technologies. The tank is known for carrying an average 60mm caliber gun and also fitted with intercom which can be used to call an armored vehicle. The Batman Prefect is often used to defend positions and cities, or to protect fighter aircraft for infiltration or bomb operations. The vehicle has very high survivability against gun-based attacks. The engine contains mostly bunker-busting, night fighting and ammunition regeneration.

## ZEN

The Zen tank is one of the military's oldest vehicles. Notably, these tanks have no evolutionary period. The engine of this vehicle is the CEGE (cell. The tank has a 1.8 liter diesel engine with two manual turbosuperchargers. The tank is often referred to as the Zen in all its mechanical forms. The Zen tank is typically upgraded to armor equipped with heavy 0,50mm machine guns or MPK cannons. The tank was developed during World War 2 and used by the Soviets on their famous armored divisions Stalingrad and Mezhyhirya. The Zen's speed is generally 30 to 60 km/h.

## H-97 EXPRESS

The H-97 Express tank is produced by the Willys Company from 1956 to 1960. The H-97 Express is often considered the backbone of the 24th Armored Cavalry Regiment (AWRC) tank division, and represents the best appearance of the Osmar L86 frontal-mounted tank. This may indicate its stable performance. It may also indicate that the armor is made from the military polyethylene rather than polypropylene or other lightweight aluminum material, with light armor and these parameters reinforced. The armaments of the H-97 Express are identical to those of the H-63L. The 100mm frontal gun is fitted to the top of the turret with an 80mm anti-aircraft cannon. The H-97 Express is known for handling exceptionally well against coastal armored forces. The tank has a range of 16 km on the road and 16 km at medium range, although it can reach 25 km at 155° illumination, without a cooling system.

## EX-LANDROVERS

The Ex-Landrovers armored vehicle is heavily armored and has a cannon. The Ex-Landrovers was modified as a combat tank by the Browning Auto-Ordnance Company. Historically, it is considered one of the best vehicles in the world due to its superior accuracy and stealth performance, but less-effective armour protection. The Ex-Landrovers has almost no external armour. It is known for its high reliability and poor camouflage qualities, yet is significantly more than its weight and weight combined make it an excellent camo-kit. The tank is considered a heavy tank and capable of withstanding a real world engagement with an AK 47 and a Humvee at quite a distance.

## TANKORGOR

The Tankorgor tank is the backup armored vehicle. This design is generally simpler, offers more speed and still provides infantry support. The engine from a canon up to two 1350 hp A32 GM5V 1.8 litre turbo diesel engines was installed in both the transverse (side only) and longitudinal sections and 1 million cc system is mounted on a tread. Historically, the tanks were used for tank-type missions, protecting the main objective and advanced communications equipment. The tank has excellent protection from 50 mm shells and all weapon surface threats such as 88mm and 152mm rounds. The tank's speed is around 21 kph but will climb up to 30 kph unless this is restricted by terrain, particularly in dense vegetation or mountain tops.

## FUJINAMI

The Fujinami tank is a medium tank like the Yenzer (Silver Zephyr 1) but heavier. Its maneuverability can be improved by the Fujinami Erkiriju (13.5 cm gun + AT gun, thrust vector gun launcher), as well as AT guns (some mounted on the roof, midmounted gun mount). The gun size (55 mm to 100 mm) is the same as that of the Yenzer (Silver Zephyr 1), but the engine is smaller (1550 hp / 960 kg). The firepower is more even than that of the Yenzer, but since it lacks six (6) anti-tank guns, accuracy also decreases. The Fujinami was developed by Mitsubishi in 1894, but never shipped to consumer use. The tank was not unique among the designated tanks.

## MAUS

The Maus armored vehicle was a heavily armored automated vehicle developed by the Imperial Army during World War II. It is often referred to as a deserter tank, due to it deploying to areas away from its host civilization during World War II. Prior to 1944 it was nicknamed the Tolkhund and was available as a squad transport. It was developed and produced by the Fyodorov Manufacturing Factory in the Ukraine and recovered from a German tank storage facility under the command of Mikhail Abrahamovich Tsarov. Historically, tanks of this variety were used for troop transport. Its size was able to withstand long-range rifle fire, resulting in its anchorage in the Eastern Front during WWII. The Maus tank has acquired a reputation for being incredibly tough, earning its name as one of the toughest vehicles to battle in wartime. This design comes with fearsome camo paint, fog packs, speed that would make the Flak-piercing Maus look like nothing else.

## BAKU HIT

The Baku Hit tank was modeled after the tank movement and tank life cycles of the Yakhont, the last gladiatorial combat arena in war-torn modern-day Russia. The Baku Hit's maneuverability allowed it to exploit blind spots and gaps in front-line defense. The Baku Hit tank is known to be capable of mid-air jumps with rapid drive, mounting heavy 120mm howitzers, as well as intervening at least one nuclear missile defense platform in every firefight. It has the first land-attack and road-mobile gun of any Russian tank. The tank was developed after the seizure of the city of Tiyas, destroying much of the regional supply lines with bombs before anyone even noticed the roads were open. It is likely that Tiyas was used as a staging ground for such tanks to be trucked back in at the end of the battle. The Baku Hit's size meant it could come in for regular warfare with three Panzer IVIs, or three Russian Abrams tanks. Historically, it was employed by either the Institute of Defense Technology (Yugoslav Defense and Military Complex (yes, seriously) in Izrain).

## TOLKON

The Tolkon armored vehicle is a strategic armored vehicle, developed for the Afghan Army and used by the US as a counterterrorism and security solution to the insurgency. Its size and capabilities make it an excellent fighter, and therefore, a preferred tactical solution to be used by Afghan troops. The Tolkon has a velocity of 20 km/h and is able to execute various functions including headshots, tranquilizer darts, demolition or breaching grenades, and mortar round strikes. The tank's weaponry is divided into three variants: APCBC + driver, Dual-Trip Mine Detector + driver and APCBC + Mine Stacker + driver. The Tolkon also features several Vibro-Trip Mines for 3mm or heavier steel penetrators. The final variant, armor-piercing AA-Coated Anvils can be fired over great distances.

## PASCHIMROIET

The Paschimroiet tank was designated in 1980. Its appearance is typical of contemporary tankry: aluminum, one-piece armor, controlled recoil and four gun ports (the main cannons have a roof mount). The Paschimroiet has a torso length of 438 mm. Its speed is about 60 km/h, and can undertake countermeasures and escape from place to place. The armor is mounted on the armor plating of the turret. Historically, 1 Panzerkampfwagen I.D.C., has served with the 6.Ws.m.

## SONDERKOMMANDOS

The Sonderkommandos armored vehicle is a line commander's favorite vehicle. The armaments of the vehicle include mopeds, hand grenades, and automatic weapons. The armor of the armored vehicle (tank). The tank was developed by the German company I.T.M.G. Company to bolster its anti-aircraft gun array. The tank's ability to destroy incoming aircraft and anti-tank guns becomes very useful during ground operations, though there are not enough vehicles to match the rank of a Kpfw.VLS. The Sonderkommandos lacks a turret and is based on only half-track chassis with autoloaders. The tank was originally made by the Stäbischer company in 1969 as part of the M23 mobile armored troop transport, designated MLH-7K.

## MORGENSTURMFRAGE

The Morgensturmfrage armored vehicle was designed by Jens C. Melandrum and is intended to serve as a defensive position for armored fighting vehicles, such as the Stugger, for a specific time period, such as zero hours. The tank has 9 gun turrets, 8 ZiS-59 auto rifles (2 loaded) and 2 M240 medium machine guns, providing around 3 kilometers (1.5 mi) of visual vision with both glacis and vented structure. The tank was developed in the early 90s by Zimmermann for special forces organizations like the Norwegian Navy. The tank is known for its brutal armor piercing ZAI-43 cannons. The Morgensturmfrage's speed of 10 mph (22 km/h) on the paved surface is quite slow, and in operational situations a 7 ton attack body is not able to completely destroy a tank. Historically, the Bosch-produced SPIKY armored vehicles have been referred to as the 'Griffon'.

## KOMMANDO 16

The Kommando 16 armored vehicle was later upgraded with a unique electric engine and much improved drive train and suspension capabilities. The Kommando 16's appearance remains unchanged, however, its production models were converted to carry heavier and better armor than its predecessor. The Kommando 16's speed is equivalent to a T-72B main battle tank, its mass is 250% of its predecessor's and its battery power consumption is 50% higher than the Kommando 16's. The tank has eight D-10M radio unit mounted in the driver's cockpit, six squad commands and a medium machine gun mounted in the main gun. Its maneuverability is also improved, it has a faster speed than a T-72B main battle tank and can maneuver by itself at any speed. The tank was designed to fight off American anti-tank guided missiles at ranges of 500-700m and remain in formation at ranges up to 600m without worry of being overwhelmed. It has a lighter crew size than the T-72B main battle tank and possesses an even larger engine.

## KOPART

The Kopart tank was a Soviet combat tank that served as a troop transport and reconnaissance vehicle. Notably, it never completed its 70th day of combat. The tank is considered a workhorse among Soviet infantry. The Kopart's size and speed made it an effective infantry fighting vehicle, making it an ideal vehicle for serving mechanized units. This design featured a base conversion for heavy artillery and a smaller tripod to extend its range. The engine and parts were converted into fireproof models by Soviet designers.

## LISKER

The Lisker tank was a full-size, 44mm Soviet tracked armored column and artillery unit. Notably, one of the engineers of the Lisker wanted to equip the tank with an SMG-type weapon because such a weapon would be quicker and easier to use. The tank's size and frontal area meant it needed to be built for a straighter combat front. And a more tactical front would help improve battle effectiveness, since armored vehicles tended to follow their armor whenever possible. The armor design was based on Soviet designs, but also incorporated many American variants. The Lisker's speed and mobility could lead it to focus on patrols and stop moving if they were hit. The engine was an American-designed, 15-cylinder radial diesel engine featuring valves, fuel injection, and a rotating camshaft.

## ANTIGA SHIPYARDS

The Antiga Shipyards armored vehicle is originally designed for areas that are able to support heavy artillery, mines, and rapid movements, such as old Castiglioni supply lines. The armor features an enhanced support system with a Hydraulic Cannons or Magnum Instantiators and Assault Cannons. The first steel reinforced armor version is also present, although its damage is relatively high compared to the Chiron for the infantry tank. It was developed for warfare in the world of Cimmeria under the leadership of President Callisto. The Antiga Shipyards's ability to handle heavy artillery was proven in the 11th Caracalla Siege on Anghura, as the Antiga Shipyards was a decisive part of a successful siege of the Castiglioni city-states. Notably, the Engine on the Antiga Shipyards is more powerful than the light engines and the hull for its construction is composite materials rather than the heavy brass tanks. The engine featured on the shield is connected to a mated turret where it carries 24 heavy cannons that can fire on 280 kilometers of range.

## YAROSHATO

The Yaroshato tank was constructed for the defense of the capital city of Yaroshiga shortly after World War II. Historically, the Yaroshato was a medium tank and it was one of the most widely used tanks in the Second World War and thereafter. The armor was achieved through improvement and production of a new hull and piston assembly which had been never before tested or developed by any army in history. The tank is known as an M/3463 in South Korea and as the M/3554 in Japan. The tank was equipped with standard front and rear weapons and drive train options. The tank's ability to carry 12 16 cm KwK 42 L/51 cannon was not known, but it was assumed that it would be mounted on a M109A3 fixed-wing aircraft. The tank's appearance is that of a small fortification with the tank receiving both smoke and illumination for protection. The tank's maneuverability is located under the turret, far from infantry contact.

## EL ROSARIO

The El Rosario armored vehicle was developed for the 1970s in response to the Soviet Union's ongoing modernization program. The El Rosario tank was produced under the designation of the tank ZOV 231. Its speed-protected utility hull (ZOV 231H) can support a crew of only three. The engine has a ventral belt track, allowing the maximum capacity of 350 L/41 km (200 mi) to be stored in the armor. Two crew members can ride on the turret side and use emergency escape pod to escape as the tank crew proceeds with their task. Its ability to mount both automatic loader and external power generator makes it an effective combat vehicle. The El Rosario has a stealth capability, since if a target is spotted in close range, it will remain hidden. One can place (200 mm) fortified tires, used as anti-armor devices, or jamming devices on the interior, and the tank will remain hidden.

## MANCHUKHAN

The Manchukhan tank is a medium tank. It is two people by definition. The Manchukhan tank is known for it's ruggedness, value in protection and safe mobility. This design includes armed turrets, hi-speed stabilization, guided munitions and advanced fighting equipment. The modular design of the vehicle allows for future builds. The tank is often made in countries where mechanical difficulties make easy repairs from paper, metal and screwdrivers. The tank has aluminum armor plate at the sides, dual reverse tracked weapons on the front and vertical slide track on the rear. The engine is a 240 hp KV-100 diesel engine produced by Salk in 1944.

## PANZERSCHRECK

The Panzerschreck tank was developed as a division of Panzerfaust 30, using a fully synchronized armament with a 50 mm cannon on both sides of the driver. The Panzerschreck has the combat characteristics of a close-combat tank with a 20 mm self-propelled gun and 6 main guns on the front and rear sides. It was designated. The armor was specially created and it is essentially a mixture of German super hardened steel and composite plating. It has a rating of: 98 to 99 mm: 110 to 112 mm: 105 to 110 mm: 60 to 65 mm: 45 to 50 mm: 30 mm: 19 mm: 12 mm: 10 mm: 7 mm: 6 mm: 3 mm: For other tank characteristics, see this article on Armored Vehicles. Its speed is 4.3 km/h when travelling at 20 km/h with a half hull suspension. The tank was developed as a division of Panzerfaust 30, using a fully synchronized armament with a 50 mm cannon on both sides of the driver.

## THINMAN

The Thinman tank was intended as a security tank for fighting only close-quarters enemy toll... However, there was a problem: someone had crafted the core components in Silicon Valley, and somehow sabotaged these secret specifications by importing them here in Egypt... The tank's ability to operate in great numbers is called fragility, but there's a catch. This design can't resist gunfire, damage caused by bullets, armor, or explosives... You need to deploy it during crises. The tank is considered moderately defensive, but if you get it into big trouble it can be easily demoralized. Don't run into any external danger in the Outer Colony when using this tank... It lacks maneuverability, it lacks armor, and it has to be packed into just one of the scores of SUVs built for transport.

## VENGEANCE

The Vengeance tank is fully armored and armed with several weapons as the CMV56. It uses Vespene Pods which allow the driver to control the weapon and damage behavior. It was considered moderately effective because it is technically double track and used in empty conditions. The tank lacks any structural protection. Notably, there are 8 air intakes and a hard point over the driver's nose. The armaments are a 40mm cannon in the front with a 75mm gun on the tank's turret, the tank also uses internal ammunition tanks. Its maneuverability and sheer toughness make it difficult to be tracked, and its capacity to absorb a great deal of shell hits and damage made it a champion in battlefields where there is great demand for Heavy tanks.

## NEW LIFE

The New Life tank is a dual-purpose tank currently manufactured by the APFSDS units of Westammer in Australia. Historically, the tanks have been used for everything from conflict scenarios, anti-personnel operations, to low-intensity warzones. The New Life's primary battle role, against friendly infantry, has already been made famous in 2007 when the tank was pulled from battle due to heavy damage to both the rear commander's and bombardier's heads and limbs. The tank's size is significantly different than the others, being able to house both the United States Marine Corps APFSDS unit M41 and a tank from NATO's European Recon Vehicle. The tank's speed rating is 76 km/h and its armor is not as good as the average American APFSDS unit. The armaments include 120mm HESH grenade launchers, 155mm M107A3 Medium Point Guided Missile launchers and 130mm M107A3 Anti-Tank Mine launchers. However, these guns cannot handle extreme heat, and its seven skirts have been converted to support the use of elevated protective cabling.

## BARBARESCO

The Barbaresco armored vehicle was proposed as an amphibious defense system for the Barbaresco family of ships. Its maneuverability and speed make it ideal for inland naval operations. The engine is interlinked with four engines. It has an infantry type of armor that provides protection at any range for up to 100 meters and an anti-tank weapon in the armored drive compartment. However, it lacks maneuverability and firepower for coastal operations. Notably, the armor is rigid and degrades quickly in the coastal environment, necessitating a partial replacement of the tank. It was designed and built under a National Research Foundation contract.

## MEHRABAD

The Mehrabad armored vehicle was developed in 1965. The Mehrabad was a relatively compact fighting vehicle used by the Saudi Arabia army, initially for reconnaissance. It was converted to armored warfare in 1973, although it retained its two combat winch systems. Due to its unconventional design, the Mehrabad was vulnerable to Israeli tanks and antiaircraft fire. This article defines the Mehrabad as a fighting vehicle based on an import into Saudi Arabia from India, but its features are closer to those of the modern India armored vehicles. The Mehrabad's feature set is lighter and more efficient than modern armored fighting vehicles.

## BHEGAR

The Bhegar tank was developed and deployed during the war. The tank's size made it suitable for close-quarter fighting. The Bhegar tank lacks gun armament and has only one turret and two guns. The armor is basic. The Bhegar tank was developed for all operational ranges except for high-risk operations such as close-quarters destruction and anti-tank work. The tank was primarily intended for close-quarter combat, mostly with RPGs or artillery.

## YIELDNIK

The Yieldnik armored vehicle was standard issue for all operational T-34/85's from the very beginning until the USSR stopped producing them at the end of the USSR era. The Yieldnik was a reliable tank and had fairly good top speed, although lacking protection against other vehicles. It was designed to compete with all of the more light and long-range Soviet medium tanks such as the T-34/85, KV-2, T-34-85 and KV-25, which were also available at a similar price. As such, it made an excellent countermeasure to them and served as an effective anti-aircraft gun in conjunction with the T-34's 3x 300mm AA guns. It has good range and speed as well, capable of shooting an unknown distance away. Although the Yieldnik is heavy, it can handle its load with little difficulty; therefore, it was rather unlikely to get blown up in combat. Its appearance was very similar to the Ural T-34-85 and T-34-72 in the 1990s, both of which received improvements from a design study by Shingen, the former full frontal armor variant.

## BARTON

The Barton tank is usually a lightweight 'FM' artillery tank. Its crew consists of two crewmen in specialman, and two crewmen between seven and ten, representing either 14 or 16 years old. This design is cumbersome and easy to fire when there are no fuel reserves, due to it's basic two door design. The armor is two-phase armor made of alloyed steel welded onto solid concrete. The Barton lacks storage space in front of the turret and a turret cover, so while it can put out much heavier rounds the hull compresses much heavier fire. The tank was developed for the Normandy invasion, but is in limited use by Special Forces since it can only fire weapons during sleep phase (21-22 minutes) when no ammunition is available. This can delay the Allied advance into the city, although weapons like Tracer rounds would still prove effective against the walkers.The Winchester Co. produces the Barrett Mark 5 rifle, the latter featuring a bottom mounted 7.62x39mm and a 75 mm magazine.

## LS 185

The LS 185 armored vehicle was a testing armored tank which served as an equipment test vehicle. The LS 185 tank is considered the best of the Soviet armored vehicles of its time and remains to be one of the finest tanks ever built. The LS 185 tank was used by Russian Army in the late 1970s, into the early 1980s. One of the most important features of the LS 185 is its mobility and has been maintained, in addition to its status as a test vehicle. The tank was equipped with a 16mm direct hit. During testing, not all tanks have a frontal armor, since some tanks (e.g. Its maneuverability) can perform heavy hits from the front. Historically, tanks with a frontal armor existed on the Soviet battlefield for a long time, at least since the time of Hitler.

## DOUBLE ATTENTION

The Double Attention armored vehicle is able to roll into corners and fires rocket propelled grenade rounds. The Double Attention tank lacks real weapons, only shields. Notably, the armored tank\'s technology is random, as is its camouflage. Historically, the Double Attention armored vehicle has fought a tight succession of de facto real wars that foreshadowed the current conflict in Syria. The Double Attention's ability to maneuver the weapon(s) it uses allows it to defend itself while dishing out significant damage. The tank's appearance is similar to that of a turret gun but has added firepower during the war.

## HUNGARIAN NOVOVA

The Hungarian NOvova armored vehicle was awarded the 2007 Production Australian Memorial Award for its contribution to Australian military materiel. The tank was located in Cairns, Australia on 18 August 2007 with many Australian engineers including Australian Test Driver Andy Brueggemann, Canadian Manager Robert Porter, Canadian and Italian, Italian engineers, and Australian IT Specialist Paul Bunyan working together. The armor reinforced the ammunition hangers with lightweight aluminum plates. The tank has now been restored with new gear. Notably, the vehicle was fitted with the Australian Tactical Warning System, and has thermal protection measures, as well as a removable water filter and enhanced suspensions and engine protections. The tank's speed is 120 km/h (70 mph) and its driving range is 200 km (120 miles). It was introduced to Australia for testing in August 2007 and has already undergone extensive field testing with South Australia's armed forces.

## DEUX ARCHETS

The Deux Archets armored vehicle is a maneuverable defensive mechanism. The Deux Archets has a turret mounted on the front body; at the rear of the vehicle is a laser turret. There are 14 point defense modules on the tank, instead of the usual 4. The armaments are mounted in three rows on the front of the vehicle: Cannoneer Machine Gun, 2mm Armored Carriage, and Machine Gun Missile Launcher. Notably, these modules are fitted in the Advanced Protection mount, making the Deux Archets a reserve vehicle. The tank was designed as a tank but was released as a tactical reconnaissance vehicle, not a frontline combat vehicle.

## RESOLUTE PZKPFW IV

The Resolute PzKpfw IV tank is Russia's main battle tank, designed for infantry and armored warfare roles. The tank's appearance comes from an armored design covered with a protective shell called an armored shield. Over time, this armor has been replaced with a composite canvas skin that protects against small-caliber weapons. The Resolute PzKpfw IV tank has a base speed of 90 km/h and is capable of outmoving infantry targets up to 3,150 meters. This design makes it possible to engage targets from more than 60 km away. Notably, only 5 of these (4 in 40cm gun) are currently under development. The armored block weighs about 17 tons and can carry only about 14,000 kilograms, including a commander.

## DESERT EAGLE

The Desert Eagle tank was developed during World War 2 in order to protect land armies against enemy ground attack forces. This design built on the iconic German 75 mm Mle 20 SA towed howitzer developed for these requirements in 1908 and incorporates much of the panzerfaust characteristics common to this, but greatly increases performance and accuracy. The Desert Eagle tank is often found in heavy forces of traditional armies; however, the unit doctrine includes units that can be equipped with Desert Eagles in support of land forces. An Armored Personnel Carrier is typically identified by a special chassis emblem. The documentation for the Desert Eagle tank: The desert eagle is an icon adopted by armored corps commanders and maintenance teams to indicate that a unit is not necessarily army size. Its use by army personnel who use them on their own time gives them a singular appearance and gives them a name meaning. The Desert Eagle lacks any artificial chain-mail like elements on its armor, and therefore the panzerfaust, fixed mount, rockets/stun guns, and heavy machine guns are true basic panzerfaust variants, having been acquired at or around the outbreak of war.

## ADVENTUB

The Adventub armored vehicle was released in 1967. This design was based on a 1964 Abrams tank that carried enough power to get through extended urban combat using its full 35 mm gun and canisters and 32 mm anti-tank shells. It is often mistaken for the StuG III. The Adventub tank was able to defeat the German Bf 110 E which was armed with a similar Panzer IV turret, and even operated the Ostkriegwagen 42 tank of a tank division, whose crew was manned by 28 Austrians. The Bf 110 E which in turn encountered the armored transport, was ultimately destroyed. Historically, the Adventub has been used by our tactical forces. The Adventub tank is considered a war tank.

## LITTLE BOY

The Little Boy armored vehicle was described by AMC as the ``Block I`` and was probably the most devastating armored vehicles of the world. The Little Boy tank could be pulled by an ARU personnel or armored personnel carrier when hit by anti-tank weapons. The Little Boy's size, height, weight and armor capacity were all unique attributes and proved to be deadly in early Vietnam. The engine was 120hp and operated by a hydraulically operated rotary diesel. Historically, the Little Boy was also equipped with sophisticated armament: it could shoot APFSDS rounds as well as mortars and fired 26mm mortar rounds at a distance of up to 450 yards. The tank lacks a radio and a crew, but it has a small automatic water pump, small clearance tires, an anti-side chassis and a fold-down mattress. The Little Boy's basic operation was to roll to the side and reload, then roll at short range. Notably, the tank lacks any strategic defense, since the tank's crew was never deployed.

## STALAG-1

The Stalag-1 tank is partially constructed from defensive materials, including rubber, leather, anti-tank gear and other armored materials. The Stalag-1 tank is known for its outstanding armor protection, based on the set of light armor protection defined by the Korea Foreign Military Sales Act (1990). It has a wheeled hull with a horizontal fin to permit easier maneuvering and making handling simpler. The Stalag-1's internal equipment room consists of an ammo bays, magazines and ammunition pouches, along with the abovementioned tools and protective gear. The Stalag-1 is considered one of the best armored weapons against ground enemy vehicles. The Stalag-1 was developed by the U.S. Army Technical Development Command in response to such problems in M60 main battle tanks. The Stalag-1 tank lacks rail attachments for additional protection. It was not designed for heavy weapons to mount on, for example; guns, submachine guns, ATGM launchers, grenades or even SPG-7 assault rifles.

## CARNEGIE

The Carnegie armored vehicle was deployed in 1949 to protect operations against heavy enemy fire and hostile invasion, but was supplanted by the lighter Patton. The tank is a medium construction, but large enough to move slowly when necessary, and is susceptible to multiple gun and tractor blast damage. The Carnegie has 60mm armored field gun (for extended and close combat), three machine guns and tractor blast, and 40mm machine gun and heavy mortar. Its armor plate supports equipment for 96mm gun, and armor seems to extend further, as it is encountered on later covers. The tank's armored superstructure is curved and non-static, providing it is not heavily damaged. Thanks to a sight that has rolled pointy bumps, and to the gun firing spin mechanism installed at a sloping forward part of the turret. The Carnegie was easily over-gunned by infantry, but heavy pushback could be initiated by low-flying Shorai fighters.

## ENFORCER

The Enforcer tank was designed and manufactured in the United States by Daimler Chryslers armored engineering of Manchester, Tennessee. The Enforcer's ability to withstand damage after performing regular indirect fire, gunnery, and heavy armor piercing rounds, as well as its ability to carry heavy loads, provide it the ability to withstand mechanical damage such as fragments, flashfire and explosion. It was designed to handle 50,000lbs of fuel on top of its limited weight of 18,000lbs (15.8 tonne). The Enforcer lacks armor piercing rounds or strafing ammunition. The Enforcer's maneuverability and weapon versatility allow it to carry 120 lbs of heavy ammunition over the length of its tank. The Enforcer also has machine guns mounted along each side of its turret, which can pierce most armor (10mm) covering its turret. The machine gun can be used to shoot enemy vehicles from above or to clear obstacles from below or around the tank, or to return fire and detonate flak and grenade rounds.

## HELIOX VEHICLE

The HelioX vehicle tank was an American development program for Armalite Tank Line, primarily developed in World War II. The HelioX vehicle tank was designed as a lightweight, air-borne, missile-evading heavy tank and can withstand air-to-air combat against enemy aircraft. The tank's appearance closely resembles a Patriot tank as well as other 19th century armored vehicles that featured angular turrets in all directions. The hull consisted of a hexagonal plate made of steel-hulled wood. It has a bi-turret on the front and an integrated anti-tank weapon on the rear. Historically, such vehicles are distinguished by their shape and armored armor. In Armalite Tank Line's design, the HelioX vehicle tank was rather modestly armed. It is considered one of the best in its class in terms of potential anti-tank firepower and in terms of survivability and mobility.

## IVAN PINA

The Ivan Pina tank is the standard fight vehicle for the Scum, with its high tank hardness and highest possible armor. The tank's 4 torso armor pieces make it hard to damage and crush tanks, unlike most enemy tanks, which require some sort of armor kit. The Ivan Pina is often assumed as the best tank in groups, making it more of a threat and an ideal assassin. This design is particularly adept at taking down larger targets such as Grizzly Bears, Mongoose Wolves, and Griffons, making the Ivan Pina ideal for any situation. Notably, the Ivan Pina's armored treads and small hexagonal hull hulk help greatly to keep other tanks out of the fight. The tank was equipped with a ventral vision sensor system. The Ivan Pina's appearance is slightly different than that of the Grizzly Bear (which also requires a ventral vision sensor), with white armor instead of black and silver paint in all the corners. It also sports an M1074 heavy machine gun, flanked by two heavy rifled machine gun barrels.

## ZP9AE3D

The ZP9AE3D tank is one of the simple four-wheel-drive tanks used by the Soviet tank troopers for defense, reconnaissance and mobility. The tank's maneuverability comes from the model; it has five car engine and three diesel engine for driving and handling. Historically, its powerplant was a 3.5-liter six cylinder diesel engine. The engine is ideally suited for driving over sharp ground and requires little cooling. It may be built with multiple variants - 360hp four-cylinder diesel engine with 360hp four-cylinder engine is available, 120hp four-cylinder diesel engine with 120hp four-cylinder engine is available. Its size and weight help also its heavy armor. The ZP9AE3D is known for being the toughest armored vehicle, providing 1,500hp and 2,000 vehicle crew. The powerplant used on the tank might be a 3.5-liter six-cylinder diesel engine with 360hp four-cylinder engine, 120hp four-cylinder engine with 120hp four-cylinder engine or a diesel engine with 120hp four-cylinder engine and 360hp four-cylinder engine.

## SHANNON-RUMBLE

The Shannon-Rumble tank was developed by Time Corporation. The armor is based on the very best materials made by the kinetic energy engine of Nerv. The controls and computer interface are located on the underside of the tank. The armaments consists of the M79A3 cannon and the M55A5 missile launchers. The Shannon-Rumble's ability to inflict heavy damage is attributed to its suitability against mechanized and armored targets. The Shannon-Rumble is known for being able to strike targets, even without exploding, from concealed positions or while in foliage or other obstructions. Notably, it also can hit targets at night.

## FLYING HUNTER

The Flying Hunter tank is a semi-mobile, single tank hull propelled by a heavy machine gun and single main gun. The tank was first proposed in 1902 as a heavy armored infantry defensive formation during World War I. Description The Flying Hunter tank is extremely lightly armed with little armor piercing ammunition, though its 120mm main gun is capable of hitting a handful of medium tanks. Historically, this tank has been used for defensive purposes by the German Wehrmacht, which was fighting in Eastern Europe against Allied troops. Its size and maneuverability allow it to easily invade both urban and rural areas against obsolete or weak units, allowing it to gain useful terrain advantage. The Flying Hunter tank is capable of challenging any enemy threat from an all out assault in an ambush position.

## GMB

The GMB tank was in development from 2005 to 2008 at the GMB factory in Tiburon, California. It is based on two design elements: a frontal turret, which used exposed steel armored plate and a side armor that was composed of steel titanium to form the sides; and a rear armor that was composed of stiff ceramic composite tubing to add lateral rigidity to the sides. This design for the GMB armored vehicle has been approved by the government and military. The GMB tank is considered a prototype that can be easily assembled and can be shipped abroad at a subsidized price. It can withstand impacts of torpedoes, cannons, artillery, and guided missiles. The tank's ability to withstand, coupled with its flexibility for warfighting, has made it a preferred vehicle for the United States military in recent conflicts, especially in Somalia. The GMB vehicle was finally shipped to China for manufacturing in 2009.

## MU-8010

The Mu-8010 armored vehicle was used for reconnaissance by Turkish military during the First World War and for sector-wide defense roles against the German tank movement in the Battle of the Bulge. The Mu-8010 was built by Henry M. Scherer Co. of Alpena, N.Y., under contract to the U.S. Army on 29 November 1917. The tank was equipped with a 105mm gun and 1,700 lb. The armor protected the crewmen in the compartment 2. The Mu-8010's development included high grade components such as a 65-point chin door and 35 percent construction strength glass. Its maneuverability is expected to improve during operation, during which time the tank will be mounted with M1A2 Abrams Stryker III and front mounted MG 8s.

## TSAR BA-LAZ

The Tsar Ba-laz armored vehicle is the Russians' flagship, an exceptionally powerful armored vehicle. It makes up its role not only by packing premium armor but also by offering a variety of upgrades to improve the vehicle's performance. It is considered among Russia's top forces. The Tsar Ba-laz was developed at the start of the century as an armored model, but was retired by 1983, replaced by the Black A54 armored MBT. This design was unable to handle today's modern weapons and armor. It lacks in firepower, mobility, mobility support and good protection, but it provided its original purpose of threat control.

## WOLFBROTHER

The Wolfbrother tank is often considered as one of the most popular Russian armored tank/destroyers that had proved successful in the invasion of Germany. Its ability to function as a division battle tank is not enhanced when the amphibious railgun is installed on it. The armor and protection granted by its (large) armament include HEAT/HEB-T and APHE shells and both systems can also use the vehicle's swept turret for striking airborne targets. The Wolfbrother was manufactured by Rusinovskaya Electriciaich tank factory, one of the major members of the second-largest Russian arms firm, Tula. Early prototype models (1965-1971) were equipped with LTV-3.107 and LTV-3.110 artillery rockets. Early production units utilized LTV-3.120, with LTV-3.121 being produced in 1966. A few units of this version received the LTV-3.135 round and during Soviet occupation in 1968, the LTV-3.150 round was also carried on this tank.

## MARDI GRAS

The Mardi Gras armored vehicle was first introduced in 1973 as a test tank for the 75th Armored Reconnaissance Battalion, 101st Combat Engineer Company, 101st Engineer Company, U.S. Army. Soldiers living and working in Russia were specially trained to operate the vehicle. The armored truck was the first U.S. version of the small repair vehicle since the German M51A2 Sherman. This design allowed an Army soldier to drive three small vehicles at the same time in only one tank and was expected to make an effective contribution in changing combat conditions. The Mardi Gras tank is armed with a 75mm round in the turret of both sides and eight TOW anti-tank missiles mounted in an elevation hoist above the turret. The engine is a single prop diesel engine with a gas generator and hydraulics in the lower deck. The tank is considered in service with the Border Police Battalion (25th Infantry Division).

## MYONIAN

The Myonian tank was born from military science and the personal initiative of a single soldier named Gorka. It had 1 standard commander and 30 seats of three minutes each. This design was applied to a wide array of standard armored vehicles from the Browning M3 armored road motorcycle to the Tomin/T99 heavy tank, which featured a nearly doubled engine capacity. The tank was developed to defend frontier areas where it was best used: urban platoons for ambushes, full-fledged divisions for direct assault, and skirmishing against offensive forces. It has gained respect from all sides, and is enjoyed by a number of great warriors. The tank is known for having powerful cannons, armor piercing cannons, and excellent AP guns, they are near instant kills and are a good choice for tank rangers.

## STICKYBACKER

The Stickybacker tank is a standard 2.5 meter long vehicle that looks similar to an MX-8 pistol, but has 15 armor points with 5 hull plate and 10 manueverable gun slots. Due to the split structure it becomes 2 medium heavy vehicles with 14 armor and 4 armor points with 4 hull plate and 8 manueverable gun slots (of which 2 have 3 gun slots), and the rest in standard armored vehicle for comparison. The tank was only tested in CBT. The Stickybacker has the slowest top speed of the vehicles, and allows you to jump under enemies due to its manueverable hull. It was equipped with special properties, the main gun was an 8A3 howitzer, like a scorpion or tank destroyer, with a maximum range of 30 meters (400ft). The tank's appearance is typical of a company of light vehicles, with its 5 hull plate slots, 20 manueverable weapons, strong front-mounted armor and 0/9 armor penetration.

## GRANDNADO

The Grandnado tank was specifically designed for defending the progress of the highway and cities, especially in mountainous areas. Historically, however, it was modified to repair destroyed tanks and armored vehicles of greater military importance. It has fast armor, shielding, gun turrets, and a turret that fires artillery shells. The Grandnado's maneuverability and firepower allow it to carry out emergency transportation of heavy weapons. It lacks a large enough gun to carry any automatic weapons. However, the Grandnado is armed with thirty machine guns and five types of artillery shells. The Grandnado is often pitted against side tanks of various class of combat.

## HITLER II

The Hitler II tank is one of the six tank models unlocked at level 30, 45, 50, and 60. The Hitler II tank was developed in 1989 and is an old and lightly armoured configuration of Soviet design with small chassis, a shallow turret, and a deep slope frontal armor. It is also basically an American light tank due to its heavier gun. Its maneuverability is mediocre, hence this is the tank used by Germany as a strategic positioning tool until it finally dropped in strength. Like the older Soviets, this is also known for being slow, but the removal of the internal fuel cell in the 30cm gun significantly increased its maneuverability, thus allowing it to still use its speed to escape flanks and engage their defenders in flanks. The Hitler II's ability to be converted to a medium tank allows it to engage smaller opponents such as light tanks, making it the next best tank to a German heavy tank, which is of course where the German KV-4, WL-2, PzII, and later Speer APCs all excel. Historically, most KV-4s served with Germany as guardians against the Soviets, being replaced by the Panther or Tiger prototypes.

## CLASSIC BRONZE

The Classic Bronze tank is a classic American tank which is primarily known for its camouflage design. The engine has a long axis for fire control and multiple independent tracks for giving a fine vane shape to armor. Its appearance is inspired by a series of dioramas found in the Art of Fighting Collection which were designed by William Sprague Rodrick. The Classic Bronze lacks both steel armor and the Cold-Fusion armor, just like the American M1141, but each of these modifications had a very important purpose: they allowed for lighter weight and easier handling while still granting protection. Its low profile and off-road performance is unique and its tank bodies are relatively comfortable, making it especially easy to go where you want without being covered. The chassis of the Classic Bronze is unique and feels good with only a few modifications made. This design however needed a proper camera mount because the tank is tilted vertically, which severely restricts the range of forward and aft vision. The armor plate is asymmetric, which allows for tracking capabilities of tracks, but doesn't allow for much in the way of protection from enemy fire.

## GISSLOWSKI

The Gisslowski armored vehicle is the mechanized front line of VZU-1 in World of Tanks. The tank's an automatic fighter with its armament heavily based on advanced Soviet heavy armor, such as the D-10 (and, later, the M48) and several examples of the large calibre GRAS (Heavy Grouper). The Gisslowski tank is considered the best tank design at the time. The Gisslowski tank was approved for production in 1991 and entered the global market in 1991, upon which it developed major concerns due to its large-caliber firepower and heavy armor, particularly in its rear. Its appearance was generally considered to be somewhat impressive, yet it proved to be yet another subpar chassis, which is one of the main reasons the Gisslowski tank is still put down. It has been replaced by the more successful Ghezmar M551 Sheridan armored vehicle.

## HOBGOBLIN

The Hobgoblin tank was originally created and armored by a Dwarven spy as a base for transporting guns that other Dwarves had trained. It is often placed into combat against Dwarves who wish to hold back their own power or attack other groups of Dwarves at a possible location. Notably, it can outgun almost any other tank when mounted and maintained properly. The engine of the tank is also exposed and in a sense is only protected by thick blanket, but it is capable of complex maneuvers. The Hobgoblin tank is considered relatively simple in how it is given, being constructed almost entirely of wood and stone. The Hobgoblin was designed by Bosco Sciabarra in Alabyss in order to outflank and destroy each of the four great horsemen of the apocalypse.

## LVT

The LVT tank is designed to withstand several simultaneous blows from two aircraft. This design utilizes a base platform which is reinforced against four armor layers. Notably, the aft gun section of this tank has fully maneuverable armor. Historically, only three variants have been produced, all of them armored with a lightly reinforced composite hull. The LVT is often referred to as an excellent weapon against medium tanks. The tank's ability to penetrate almost all armor increases both the hit rate and armor penetration. The LVT tank has a modular weapon mount system which can be assembled into four fully functioning variants or reconfigured for use with extra equipment such as a 4-horseclip engine. Its speed is near excellent.

## REIBER DRAGON

The Reiber Dragon tank was an experimental, classified experimental mobile suit that was eventually adopted by the Luna Transport Command as a mobile unit of light squadrons. The engine system consisted of a toroidal reactor and solid fuel tanks that contained liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. The Reiber Dragon is considered to be the first fully powered mobile suit. The tank's appearance is based on the Sakhalin Powered Ground Combat Vehicle. The Reiber Dragon and its Zero-T were prototype prototypes. The tank is known to be fired the Tomoe camouflage system due to its uniform color scheme and the ability to eliminate most targets by its laser cannons. The Reiber Dragon suffered heavy damage during a foot pursuit attack, shortly afterwards the last two pips that survived were melted to make the armor left intact.

## POPZEL ZONTUNG

The Popzel Zontung tank was designed for early battle, werefore it entered service as the Porirhian Prototype tank, the armor was deemed inadequate to withstand threats like field artillery, tanks and self-propelled anti-tank guns. Sometime later, the model was exported to many non-traditional countries in Eastern Europe, such as Poland, Ukraine and the Russian Federation, during the Red Army's Second World War, however the concept was not adopted, only later upgraded to be used on the new Vladivostok-class battleship of the Kurile. The Popzel Zontung's ability to protect its crew from enemy assault vehicles, caused its successors to emerge earlier models, such as the Popzel Kintorevich.The Popzel Zontung's antiaircraft armament consists of a 12.7mm gun and an autocannon capable of firing 5 rounds per minute at sustained fire rate of 24 rpm. The Zontung also features the KwK 40 152mm antitank gun and the 12.7mm APDSM 30C weapon.The tanks are mounted on mostly smoothbore hulls. The tank chassis of the Popzel Zontung has three 4M 76mm guns on both sides, and its 9M 75mm gun is mounted on the right side. The Popzel Zontung tank has a usable crew of four people, mostly crew members serving the gun crew.Standard armor thickness of the Popzel Zontung is 8.7 mm at the top, 7.2 mm at the sides and 4.3 mm at the bottom, however the anti-personnel gun can not compensate the entire thickness of the tank.

## COMMANDANT SON

The Commandant Son tank was one of the armored tanks made by ''Dropping Turtle''. It is considered to be the prototype of the command tank. The Commandant Son is often referred as the 'King of the Tank World', (literal because he allowed us to make the exact tank we were dreaming of). And its maximum maneuverability was on par with the Shermans. This design lead to its original name as ''Dragon''. The armor is well protected, preventing damage to the crew and the vehicles. The Commandant Son's speed and maneuverability make it a great tank for the Western Front and can hold its own in almost any situation.

## SHERMAN

The Sherman armored vehicle was an important breakthrough in tank design. Its low profile simplifies the maintenance and repair process by reducing the need for special armor and replacing the base model in the tank with an appropriate equipment package, costing less than what is currently necessary. The tank's lower profile, adding 2 meters for safety is the major reason for the difficulty in obtaining a tank with two meters of armor. The tank is often best with three vehicles: a mobile main battle tank, a light armored car and a heavy armored car. The Sherman's size makes it an easy choice of vehicle for urban infantry fighting against larger opposition. Its appearance is designed to make it a potent weapon and it is considered effective at close range.

## AUFSCHLUSS

The Aufschluss armored vehicle is featured in Battlefield 3 as a bonus class. It was introduced in the Operation: Hero's Pledge DLC. The Aufschluss's speed, armor, and behavior share similar values to those of the Armored Personnel Carrier, but its bipod system grants tactical unique features for an extra point of protection, faster acceleration, and improved tracking speed. The armor system can be upgraded for less armor but slower to repair, but again grants tactical unique features. The tank's size is comparable to an Armored Personnel Carrier (APC). The engine of the Aufschluss is a new 64.7mm-truss M10 triple-turbocharged engine rated at 1830hp and 1750lb-ft at 4000 RPM. Unlike the AT and CEC, the Aufschluss can only mount four personnel instead of six. The tank lacks sensors in its turret, creating travel restrictions for drivers and crew members.

## ZULU

The Zulu armored vehicle is capable of all manner of uses. Notably, the four of them can draw fire from the enemy within 150m and cannot engage while moving. The quadruple armored tank could also be used for offensive purposes. The Zulu is considered a heavy tank due to it having two double-barreled guns firing at a time and being capable of using Rtt. The tank can not go stationary and can only move if it has ammunition. The Zulu's ammunition is reserve ammunition. The Zulu tank has an additional 20% - 30% movement speed. The Zulu was developed as a successor to the Panther Tank because it offers enough utility against both armored and armored-naked enemy units in a single tank.

## COMMISSARIAT-26

The Commissariat-26 tank was produced in the Wehrmacht and supplied to all 3 major armies of the Old World. These tanks were the flagship and combat vehicle of General Prussia. Its maneuverability and firepower were developed from a revolutionary already designed and developed vehicle. The tank's speed was increased by a factor of 6 because of the added ammunition load. The tank lacks heat sinks and its movement mode is inefficient. The tank has an improved suspension system that makes it virtually self-sealing and acts as a buffer between engine and wheels. Due to its lower weight, it is easier to maintain and was seldom used in field service. This design has a smooth turret with deep penetration and acceleration.

## ISTVÁN NA GOMRE

The István na Gomre tank was a Mid Eastern armored column fired by the German army at the end of World War II. The István na Gomre's commander General Milivojevich Meléndez fled on his motorcycle and climbed into an American patrol truck, where he proceeded to deliver it on several occasions before finally evading the Germans and crashing into the wall. The István na Gomre's appearance was totally random and the only supporting detail on the front is the Model 42 of the 37mm gun. The tank's speed when on a rollover is simply absurd. It lacks legs and does not manage to traverse. The engine, once highly regarded for its smooth running, is a 300 hp V10 Diesel engine that it uses only to run itself at full speed.

## BO-THE-VAULT

The Bo-the-Vault tank was designed with resistance against infantry weapons and moderate on-going ventilation of smoke. This design allows the to stay above water without stopping and decreases the open-deck heat. The armor system in this armor system is housed within rectangular steel slabs that appear as a simple play of colors when present. The tank lacks the articulation of an original design but retained the advantages of such form. The Bo-the-Vault tank is known for its protection against bad weather conditions, especially on land. Notably, it uses on-going ventilation to keep the front hatch closed, similar to a gas mask.

## KOM-EH TANK HAVOD

The Kom-eh Tank Havod armored vehicle was developed by an alien race in the 2070s. The Kom-eh Tank Havod tank is considered an evolution of the ASVV type tank. The tank was designed with several major benefits, including increased protection, improved firepower, lower body armor, better maneuverability, and a more competitive rate of fire compared to previous generations of ASVV tanks. The tank's speed was increased due to the high hull traverse speed due to the use of heavier armor, plus improved acceleration. The tank also has a larger tank stack, although its mobility is somewhat affected by its crewmembers. This design means that only large vehicles can be fully supported by this tank, making it a better outfitted soldier than a regular tank. The Kom-eh Tank Havod tank was built in two main variants: a main body tank and a rear hull tank.

## MK-21

The MK-21 armored vehicle was constructed to fulfill certain requirements. The tank is armored against hard to target infantry weapons such as machine gun and grenade launcher. The tank was designed to withstand multiple fire, while maintaining an armor piercing bonus to its own turret. It was manufactured in strict order to meet the Russia's production standard. The tank's ability to repel small arms fire has proved extremely effective in shooting down medium and large caliber small arms of any armament. Its armor helps effectively against high speed, intermediate range and turreted targets. The tank's armor is mostly made from rubber or plastic sheeting without any occuring rosin. The armaments found on the tank are fired via a variety of traditional means.

## UJII

The UJII tank was not considered too difficult to construct. It consists of two chassis. Its biggest sections are 0.45m in length, 12.2cm high, and 4.1cm thick, while the last unit is 0.5m long, 4.9cm thick, and 20.4cm thick, with an armour thickness of 0.35m. The tank is known for its wide ability of handling roads and wide highways, and its loadout includes: 88mm howitzer, 100mm mortar, 25mm SMG, 15mm HEAT gun, 4.5mm rocket and 34mm ATGM artillery. The UJII's ability to move up to 0.3m is able to hit multiple targets simultaneously. The tank's size comes from its horizontal stance, whose forward portion is extended from the front and is parallel with the ground.

## KØRPPALHELA

The Kørppalhela tank is an advanced Kursk armored tank. Notably, it has no teleporters. Its ability to evade incoming fire allows it to live in the thick of battle with relative ease. Historically, it is assumed to be the best tank of the German Luftwaffe. Large numbers of Kursk armored tanks were destroyed by the Soviets and by English and American planes during World War II. However, in fact the Kursk is incredibly effective at its main function - fighting back against enemy guns. It is often considered to be the finest anti-tank of its type. The Kørppalhela's speed is 45 km/h and 1,800 kg.

## DEATH SKILLED

The Death Skilled armored vehicle is a medium armored tank which is promoted for its long-range firepower and strong protection capabilities. The tank is often armed with nine F7F30 cannons mounted in the rear, four anti-aircraft cannons mounted on the front, and a boom firing launcher mounted in the hull for defense against enemy attacks. The Death Skilled was also built during the 25th Anniversary of the United Nations Space Command. The tank is capable of traversing the entire terrain of Earth and eventually its entire size. However, the vessel is not capable of traversing via slower means, such as by boats or sea ships. The tank is known to be a superior choice to other vehicle types because it can traverse unimpeded without landing, a feature unique to armored vehicles.The armored tank Prototype xxxY32JAGXK is shown here when first encountered by Captain James 'Zac' Bernard after he assumes the codename of Deputy Chief Roger Smith. It was there seen traveling along a covered bridge which has run into the years and is yet to be repaired.When it became clear that Captain Smith, 25th Deputy Chief Smith and their crew had been captured by the Dai Li, Damon attempted to escape on DeMarcus Skye's Angelship Phantom. The Death Skilled has been custom built and since the deployment of the prototype xxxY32JAGXK, it was later known as the Death Skilled Interceptor Prototype.

## IVANVAZQUEZ

The IvanVazquez tank was distributed from the steppe of America under the command of a hardened experienced engineer who was as qualified as all other tank commanders, except that he knew how to conquer the battlefield. The IvanVazquez tank is often portrayed with its armored hull mounted on two vertical tracks suspended from a rock where it makes contact with a rolling column of mud. Notably, the IvanVazquez has an explicit maximum floor (also notable is that in 1987 the military base on the island of Wota and a nearby wooded park were given low gun ranges and were modernized, the overall quality of this tank improved a lot more than the rest of the few military bases in the British East Indies. The IvanVazquez tank is known to the Brazilian army as the Texeli do Melgaço ). The armor is effective on smooth tracks, no permierra in powder. The engine in the tank contains iron tubes, which can accelerate its wheels considerably, up to 7 MPH, it can take a long distance and above 25 MPH is dangerous for its operator.

## KOMMANDOS

The Kommandos armored vehicle was the most popular tank of the 60's and into the 70's. It has now been superseded by other armored vehicles such as the Humvee and the Abrams tank. Its main component is the engine installed in a super heavy machine gun located behind the driver. The armaments of the Kommandos are three 12.7mm machine guns and a 30mm cannon located in the sides of the hull with the front gun usually mounted on the left side. The Kommandos tank was an army of pioneers coming from small private companies. The Kommandos's ability to survive fire, lubricate and camouflage would eventually be made obsolete in its final era by the development of modern helicopter armored vehicles like the AH-1 Cobra and T-55. The tank's appearance remains largely intact despite its tremendous size compared to other tanks of its time. The Kommandos has a considerable amount of armor to protect the cargo compartment and also further helps with their maneuverability as a light vehicle.

## SALWAR

The Salwar tank is roughly similar to a modified Montgomery Armored Personnel Carrier (MPC) design, with an added feature. Its external armament is a 105 mm mortar. The armaments of Salwar are equivalent to that of several 1980s armored personnel carriers, but with more grenades and mortars. Its ability to launch and support aerial attacks with missiles is different from that of many modern operational vehicles. Notably, the shell munitions of Salwar are non-compact and have a higher burn time. The tank was designed and built by the HAL MEA (Ministry of Defence), but does not have many soldiers.

## PEUGLAS

The Peuglas armored vehicle is an armored truck model and currently has 16 variants. It was one of the prototypes of the Leclerc armored van designed by DuPont of Paris and is now the most successful vehicle ever built for military use. The Peuglas is often seen in war zones where armor is required. The Peuglas was first produced in 1950, making it the first armored military vehicle in its generation. Notably, as a result of civilian roadblocks while patrolling the streets of Asia, the Peuglas began to encounter serious jams. The Peuglas is then accompanied by a 7.62 mm M48 Patton gun, providing troops with enormous firepower at short range and with the added option of exploding the crew upon contact with air vehicles or automobiles.

## CHIEFTAIN

The Chieftain tank is an armored tanks role that is best suited for heavy infantry. Historically, tank capacity has been limited, and significant amounts of armor have been compromised to limit its effectiveness....it can barely compete against some modern armored vehicles, let alone its peers, but the mid-30's well into the development stage saw a total redesign of the tank and an increase in armor-penetrating technology. The Chieftain's ability to fight with such a load comes with the growing importance of mobility....While its original loadout was somewhat confined to close support roles (weapon, vehicle, and tank drivers), recently those roles have been increasingly filled by allies. The armor protection allows for support soldiers to remain on the move without being charged or suppressed by enemy fire. The tank was developed to handle the change from machinegun-type protection in favor of precise armor piercing combat systems. It lacks the upgrade bullet acclimation upgrades (SPAR, HEAT, and FLAR) that have become widespread in modern battle tanks....The largest loss by battlefield loss is for air support, an ancient battle form. The tank has excellent damage resistance (1.75 layers) and high armor penetration.

## SPECIAL GROUP 3

The Special Group 3 tank is equipped with:  Armor (similar to an armor class of 2-4) plate armor, armor coating, and damage control armor, wrapped in a composite hull. The Special Group 3 is known as the heavy tank, and its forces are already experienced in these unconventional anti-tank tactics. It has a 15mm gun on its turret, and it is able to fire tanks at just under 1000 meters. Its armor is sturdy, solidity is superb, and the 5x5 Turret Fire is really effective against a sudden change in the terrain. In the German 1980s version it was nicknamed the Spyship. Its power and mobility is similar to the Russian 26-36. The Special Group 3 tank is considered a fearsome adversary as they are prepared to take whatever it takes.

## EVAN

The Evan armored vehicle is designed to be an attractive sport and family vehicle. The tank was designed for the country of Germany and that it is a family vehicle, its design was approved by the main authorities of Germany. This design has both a mild attack on infantry-foot soldiers, and an effective tank-shield capable against almost all types of infantry-foot soldiers, including most machine-gun as well as artillery shelling, and that, following this anti-armor strength, the shield can be left open and supported by the entire household, allowing soldiers to concentrate their fire on targets, without having to cover the entire vehicle. The engine of the vehicle is also designed to function fully at maximum power for a minimum of four hours to achieve maximum performance of protection in the field. The Evan's body armor has four layers of very soft materials, i.e. The tank's extreme armor parts are bolted together. It was developed by Porcelain in Menlo Park, California as a family and armorial vehicle, and features four hull dimensions of 192 mm diameter and 45 mm deep, 250 mm wide and 130 mm high.

## HANK

The Hank armored vehicle was created in stages. It was tested in the Neumos, but very soon was replaced by the Griffin. This design was then reworked, eventually becoming the multi-purpose road warrior prototype. It weighs 2,000 tons and is 7,500 meters long, with a crew of 6. The Hank is powerful enough to complete the 2,000 mile trek in 20 days, or 60-40 km, with a crew of two or four. The armor is armored, but very light and resistant to all infantry/firearms fire. Notably, the Hank is considered the first armored vehicle that didn't have external engine mounts.

## FATMAN

The Fatman tank is a very powerful U.S. military fighter jet, specially designed by McDonnell Douglas. It was developed to defend the United States against any nuclear attack by Soviet forces in Eastern Europe during the Cold War. The Fatman's basic design is designed to meet all Soviet fuel requirements; minimal design modifications are necessary to meet the requirements of modern surface combatants. The armor protection has been accomplished by using modified and heavily modified Ford Motor Company (the engine makers for Ford Panther, Wasp and Shermans) engine parts. The tank was designed to have two operational modes of operation: a high speed version at 15,000 mph and a medium speed version at 10,000 mph. The tank was developed under the assumption that heavy Russian airplanes and surface to air missiles would be easier to defeat than the robust F-22, including penetrator shaped charge (RPG) missile, precision guided bombs and cluster bombs.

## KAISER

The Kaiser tank was a tribute to war and life. The Kaiser was not ready for war. The tank was developed by Helmut Heitkamp of the Panzer armor division. He founded the Kaiser tank division in 1938 as a prelude to the development of the Bonkweiss tank that would become the Panther tank. The armaments used on the Panzer were based on the German Panzer series to remain competitive with the British. This design proved too heavy to use on the strategic battlefields.

## FARASIR-2

The Farasir-2 armored vehicle was featured in the Sega Mega Man series, voiced by Goro Taniō. This design is based on an old Japanese Type-06 tank (in this case, similar to American tank in appearance) that began service on the Japanese Army in 1972. A type 6 and 8 model were both produced during the 90s. The armaments consisted of a heavy machine gun in the turret, an attack chopper that carries missiles, and a super radion bullet launcher. Like the Japanese Type-0, the Farasir-2 is already familiar to Mega Man fans. It was originally intended to replace the Panzer IV, but after its failure in the middle of the '90s, it was eventually replaced by the Rool-1. It is known that the US West Coast is the next target for much use of Farasir, but West African is used for the Lat:lon engine. The Farasir-2 tank is rather frail, though it seems to be easier to extract firepower from.

## YAMAGA

The YAMAGA tank was developed as a successor of the ASW system. Historically, before the collapse of the Soviet Union, Yak-17 series armored vehicles were exported to countries like United States and Canada, while the vehicles were then distributed across the globe. As of 2018, there are still 6 YAMAGA armored vehicles listed in various countries and their 4 variants.The Kaze-02 used two external sensors (one after the other) installed on the armored vehicle for navigation and redundancy. The YAMAGA tank is considered a prototype, but it does have some capability of serving as an air defense platform as part of AMX-130-21 combat support aircraft.According to the caption below, this vehicle will be restored as a road tanker and improved tank hunter. The YAMAGA tank lacks provisions for handling three or four and more personnel. Notably, even if it is useful as a road tanker and supply tank, Yak-17 still cannot match the 4×4 trucks of 12×12 vehicles made by VY and other competitors.

## MUSKRAT

The Muskrat armored vehicle was deployed to West Africa to support the West African Response Force, or SALF, four months ago. The Muskrat tank lacks standard countermeasures in place, as it is armed with only one machine gun. The armaments include four large 50 mm rockets, two anti-aircraft guns, eight one-pounder machine guns, and a heavy machine gun mounted in the nose of the turret that fires multiple 20-round plated shells each for the right shoulder or right leg. The Muskrat was developed with the knowledge of Dzungarian factory by Defense Ministries Ukraine (DMM), and Artyom Zhupuk at Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The Muskrat's appearance bears a resemblance to the PMC (Rubber Tailmobile Containment Vehicle). The armor consists of the windshield and hull, which provides protection from the high and low temperatures of the tropical/tropical environment. It was able to withstand incredible heat and water: The evolution of the mechanical and materials qualities: It is mounted on an unknown metal structure, which enables it to achieve an incredible strength at sea (up to 4.8 TzD). This design feature opens up new possibilities for new battle tanks.

## FLAVA VAUX

The Flava Vaux armored vehicle is a massive armored assault vehicle designed by Nihon Corporation to enhance security and sustain morale for ISF operations in Okinawa and it is a standard military vehicle throughout Japan. It is often depicted as something that was inspired by the Soviet Mi-8 An-12 tank. The Flava Vaux is considered a useful combat vehicle due to its undercarriage being somewhat fragile and its low weight. The Flava Vaux is a scaled model rather than a prototype. The tank is known to include cargo bunkers for armor, ammunition and fuel storage, as well as heavy machinery. This design only appeared in Episode 4 in a theater corridor. The Flava Vaux will be more than capable of carrying both armor and combat troops. Historically, the Japanese military used small combat vehicles such as Mi-8As for land battles against advancing Chinese invaders.

## CV-TELNOMAND

The CV-TELNOMAND tank is not a mechanized or armored vehicle. It's like a regular armored vehicle. The CV-TELNOMAND tank was developed specifically for ground assault operations such as besieging enemy strongholds and offensive operations like breaching enemy positions. The tank's size and the shape made it very easy to conceal. The CV-TELNOMAND tank was combat effective in autonomous operation. The CV-TELNOMAND tank was designed with the objective of defending the positions from the enemy and liberating combat area from Soviet armored units.

## TANTO

The Tanto armored vehicle is the most powerful and effective tank on the market. Its price is very close to that of the Leopard 2, like the tanks of the US Army. The Tanto is often favored because of the Soviet contribution to the armored fighting vehicle. Its speed is less than that of the Leopard 2, but its armor is also easier to break through. The Tanto has no sight, no radio, and no flame thrower. The armaments also differ between the variants, because they're completely different platforms. The Tanto can only carry a quarter ton of supplies, whereas the Leopard 2 carries sixteen tons. The tank has roughly the same turret shape as the Leopard, but the turret is an exact replica of that of the Leopard 1.

## AYRANASIUS THEBAN

The Ayranasius Theban tank is a heavy armored tank. Its appearance is based on Roman architecture but looks more Americanized than historical. It was about the same width as a modern American car, with a 42 mm turret and a 120 mm gun. This tank can carry 8 Heavy Secondary Warheads (5-36 rounds per shell), a 20mm Machine Gun with a group of seven rounds, two 3-millimeter Machine Guns, an 8-millimeter Machine Gun and a 4-millimeter Machine Gun with a group of one shell, or just a shell. The armaments are: Ammunition, Ordnance, Ammo and Payloads. It has four crew members and 7 turrets. The firepower is comparable to the American Garand T25A.

## PRETAKARAN

The Pretakaran tank was the second most developed vehicle of the Pretakaran Empire. The Pretakaran tank has relatively low speed but its armor does significantly improve it. The Pretakaran tank is known for its powerful armour against all enemy vehicles except Bombers. Notably, its auto-gun has almost no heat range. The armaments of the tank include in its arsenal both Anti-Tank Gun, AGM-88 Davion Minigun, EMP, Rocket Launcher, AT-15c, 7.62mm Bofors Bolt-Action Rifle, 22mm Cyclonic Flame Beam Gun and 7.62mm TAC-A1 Bolt Gun. This design features the heavy right side armor, the speed of the hull and the high light ratio. It has medium armor with low gun arc rate and high damage potential.

## ASSASSIN

The Assassin armored vehicle was designed by the United States Army Combat Vehicle Research and Engineering Center (ACVREC). Its size is 6 feet 9 inches tall and weighs 7,858 pounds. It was developed as a twin turreter medium tank. During war time, over 65% of all artillery shells came from the company's INSAT-1A guided 155 mm howitzer. The APFSDS rounds were produced by Mark 62 Shells. The Assassin tank was an inspired choice for all people. The Assassin was a mix of American-made technology, Swedish-made technology and Western heritage.

## TAPS IN THE SAND

The Taps in the Sand tank is based on this tank armor model. The Taps in the Sand's ability to heal itself to full health per day as well as its ammo handling have been increased slightly. The Taps in the Sand tank also has the following speed: range: 24/40, % of Max health: 100% % of Max health % of cooldown recharge: 200 seconds If a Taps in the Sand was attacked by a hostile tank, its speed is increased by 15% instead. Its maneuverability is improved by 200% for each enemy tank it damaged in addition to the normal 30% bonus when attacking the tank. The tank was damaged by 25/40 instead of 25/60. The armor damage increases to 50/90 from 50/120 The shell damage increases to 45/80 from 40/90 The reload time for the Taps in the Sand has been changed from 5 seconds to 6 seconds. The engine damage is now reduced by 10% per stack of fuel. Its speed is increased by 35% and its ammo handling is increased by 40%.

## GUIDETOWERS

The Guidetowers tank is a late 2010 design with 110 mm of armor and 39mm of superstructure (shoulder armor), and could mount some sort of modern type mobile defense weapon (TRWC) as well. The tank uses 6 PKPS for armor protection and 9 RAMMY HEA for weapon protection. There are six pairs of track wheels for steering, but only one is used. The Guidetowers's size makes it a very suitable mobile combat vehicle, with 900 km range, fully protected by flammable skin and armor. The Guidetowers tank has a crew of 8 men. It has a crew of 3. Notably, it has little in the way of ejection capability and can only exit its route by sliding forward; thus it is equipped with a chest loader only and is not very well armored in the front.

## STRABOITE

The Straboite armored vehicle was employed by the Soviets during the cold war to protect Soviet cities against landmines. It was not used by the Bataan death squads, or any other group in Manila during the 35 years of conflict. Instead, it was put into the main battle front (Confrontation). The Straboite was developed by Slivinskiy of Slovakia, and produced by a company called Praga Type Ltd, as part of the Belorussian consortium of 22 companies, the latter was founded by Astor Povhovich Slivinsky, former chief of divisional support for the SMBF field units. The armaments of the Straboite: The Straboite's gun were increased from 58mm KwK39 to 75mm KVK17S Kralgala-39, the main gun had 8x4 MK19 36-mms VK38 turrets and a 16x5 MK26 KP4 front guns with four 70mm guns. Its appearance is as similar to a 122mm rifled gun as possible.

## TWILIGHT II

The Twilight II tank was designed to be an intermediate ground combat vehicle for the Armored Division (thanks to every tank manufacturer, as I learned while researching this article). The tank's size and firepower allow it to dominate any skirmish map, and even though the Twiit II is far more expensive than the Moala II or Challenger, they were more widely available before 1995. You might think that the Twiit II is more expensive to produce, but the Twiit III was produced over a period of four years. The Twilight II's speed limit, 35 km/h, limits its speeds to 54 km/h and its maximum speeds have been increased to 95 km/h. The armaments of the Twiit II include five 12.7 mm cannons, two 20 mm cannons, three 30 mm cannons, two 47 mm cannons and eight 15 mm cannons. The engine for the Twiit II is the 1 909 diesel engine, mounted in the rear of the turret, producing 918 hp at 7200 rpm (12,000 Nm) with a peak torque of 525 Nm. This design has more speed than any tank produced during this time, including the Mitsubishi ISM35 Panther.

## HAMMERHEAD

The Hammerhead tank is a fully-equipped, multirole tank, unlike other armored vehicles of the same description. The Hammerhead tank has 6 tracks, with a total of 24 tracks spaced apart, in a total of 12 tracks. The track system enables short battlefield excursions, though much longer ones, but requires an effective deployment technique on the part of the loader. The tracks are all heavy and stiff, with track-bumper armor (see Appendix C). The Hammerhead tank was designed with armored drive subsystems (Armor Blitz-II) in mind, and was built to stand up to penetrative fire. The engine and gun are self-extracting pumps, with pumping winches, and the pump rate is multiples the primary pumping rate. The tank was developed for special operations and reconnaissance missions.

## ARMORED BAT

The Armored Bat tank is modeled after the Bat APC. It is often equipped with anti-tank guided missiles, and can reach speeds of around 100 km/h, can cruise through buildings, and fire 105 mm guns up to 50 calibers. The armor protection is achieved with composite armor, which makes it more effective at shock-reduction of impact. The Armored Bat tank has one additional crew member, with a pilot and gunner. The armaments of the armored tank include five 122 mm howitzers, four 105 mm howitzers, and two 140 mm howitzers. The tank's ability to traverse the terrain makes it ideal for the harsh conditions of desert. The tank's reduced detection range (which reduces the attack of detection-evading small-arms fire on the moving vehicle) has allowed it to absorb anti-aircraft fire to the effect of 4 km with the rotary 70 mm howitzer in Iraq. The tank's appearance is very similar to an RPG design; both are backed up by several stave guns.

## CHAMELEON

The Chameleon tank was developed by the armored mobility company ABWZ to provide protection to armored convoys, armored road-building vehicles, and armored personnel carriers. The Chameleon's defensive protection has been improved through upgrades including armored doors, blast barriers, smoke in the tunnel, and track armor. Engine life has been extended to 100,000 rounds with many modifications. The Chameleon can travel over 9 miles (15 km) and stop completely at 200 mph. The Chameleon is designed to traverse open terrain at speeds greater than 500 mph, and will not over travel in the open. The Chameleon's ability to withstand the impacts of low-traction vehicles, even close combat maneuvers, was further advanced through construction of swiss armor plate for its steel armor front. Its appearance has changed to the 1930s style armored vehicle.

## LEOPARD

The Leopard armored vehicle is quite often an unarmored tank with many minor or no armored roads. The tank's ability to operate in urban areas is rarely ideal, and it can face unwanted obstacles such as armored enemy vehicles. The engine technology of this tank gives it an automatic turret drive system to deliver the highest possible firepower and protect it from unnecessary firing. The Leopard tank has an incredibly long range, allowing it to march and maneuver without engaging at ground level. The Leopard tank was developed as a second, alternative to its long-range main battle tank (MBT), to provide infantry personnel with support while protecting positions of surprise, against enemy counterattacks and from fire. The Leopard tank was primarily used by the French Armored Corps during World War II, it was never exported by the French Army.

## EIDE I50

The Eide I50 tank was made by Baden Arsenal in 1939 and was then abandoned during WWII. Later on several more prototypes were made for special reserve applications (Drogte's Omen is a good example). The tank was designed from bottom up, so that its engine and engine tracks (the turrets) were joined at the front and rear. This design is essentially that which is known as contemporary tank armor. Its size has been said to be 3.65 m long, it has a crew of 5 plus driver and driver support personnel with their instruments and equipment in the inside turret/fighter compartment.... It lacks propellers and does not have rollers in front.

## MYCENAE

The Mycenae armored vehicle is utilized to guard major locations in the Old World and the construction and evacuation of these locations. The Mycenae is known to be in combat with Carnatus named Ranax. None of its members can breach the armor. This design was later converted by Kukao when he completed a series of conversions of the similar armored personnel carriers used by the Turtles. The exterior of this armored vehicle was rebuilt after a series of major repairs. As a result of this remodel, it now is in striking camouflage, overall design not necessarily of which was the only difference. The Mycenae's appearance was developed from two of each central compartment, combined into a single compartment. In its current state, this particular combination has been weakened by the infusion of synthetic exterior skin and a metallic paint job.

## PULKAUFWAGEN

The Pulkaufwagen armored vehicle is a broad adaptation of the armored chassis in the Arnold Daimler. Its maneuverability, armor and handling greatly limit the armor of the tank. The armaments include two 30mm machineguns and 2x machineguns. The armor of the Pulkaufwagen can be split in three sections. Each is equipped with a plate that consists of five armor plates bolted to each section. The armored armor prevents the carriage from falling out of turret. The Pulkaufwagen's main gun can also be placed at the rear of the tank when desired.

## PLAGUE FIGHTER

The Plague Fighter tank is a medium armored tank. Its weight consists of three weapons: A musket shell on top of the hull (launched from inside the turret) shoots a conventional amount of shells and through an armored metal shield, destroying the enemy tanks behind. It has a short lifespan and is no longer issued after 5 years. The Plague Fighter was issued to troops for reinforcement during the early days of the Plague Horde: Wars of Mists, and continues to be issued until the army can improve the standard of its production. The tank's size and protection is also considerably greater than that of most tanks. It is often seen in Dark Forest, near Clearing Craggy Hill, part of Ondul Hoelbrak.

## MARIA

The Maria armored vehicle is small but has good armor and shoots very fast. The Maria's speed is equal to the Cvecker's (Chrysler B-28, T-28, T-72, STS-1) and superior to that of the SPAW T-80 (T-14, T-72, T-90, T-64). The tank's ability to destroy the enemy combat positions or light up some turrets also benefits from the armored design, because the tank can capture them with weapons it can fire on to destroy them. Its size makes it difficult to control by supporting roles like anti-aircraft, tanks that use artillery (like the Luftwaffe's SP-2, for instance) and anti-armor. The armaments of the Maria are for short range heavy rockets and howitzers and heavy machine guns for driving the tank through enemy positions. The armor on the Maria allows to move on infantry attack without giving up your ability to support arms from other vehicles. The Maria is known to be able to defend against rocket launchers and howitzers. This design of mobile armor made on the T-72A is definitely one of the best in the world.

## KIRUI

The Kirui armored vehicle was one of the Light Armor vehicles manufactured by the Space Marine Corps during the Horus Heresy. It was designated as the Kirui-class heavy tank by the then-Provisional Authority for Space Marine Forces, led by Kurtis Jorgensen. The vehicle was modeled after a Krogan tank from World War II. The Armored Kirui is designed primarily for close combat with a small mobile biker or howitzer role, given that a kurgan auto-barrel autoloader can also be seen in it. This article is also about the variant that was designated as the VS-144. The tank's appearance differs from the standard Kirui as shown in this comparison of variants: the Kirui-class heavy tank variant with a 44-mm armor penetration gun and additional small armor-piercing rounds (200-mm Capacity).

## SULLIN

The Sullin tank is used primarily in all economic operations, including during operations against urban insurgency. Its speed allows it to escort tanks to the front line by vehicles trailing behind it. An American tank is approximately nine meters long, with its gun mounting a 50mm cannon. Description : The Sullin is a research-funded Armor research vehicle. The Sullin tank has a thick frontal hull that provides armor protection against most modern tanks, as well as a nonlinear protection system that protects the vehicle from small arms fire. This design provides superior protection against small arms fire as well as against explosive fragmentation, also called shrapnel. The tank's size and grip strength allow the Sullin to plow through obstacles of all shapes, sizes and colors, enabling it to carry infantry, recon forces and mechanized vehicles without fear of damage to its hull.

## FANTA

The Fanta tank was designed for air transportation and transport of heavy payloads in primitive open spaces. The Fanta has small radar gun and integrated helmet protection, but its primary weapons are its automatic gun and its two range-finding antennas. The Fanta's ability to tow and maintain a tow crew is also a bonus. The Fanta's maneuverability is high, it is armed with the large twin turbo rockets used to launch its antitank missiles. Due to its limited armor, it has a terrible mobility and loadout, but it is lightweight, durable, fast, and does not really fare well against damage. The heavy concrete sides provide armor but allow the tank to self-rescue in distress. The Fanta tank has a short climb time, is somewhat maneuverable and useful in tank fights, and its low mass makes it very easy to transport to supporting regions. The engine unit is the Ram development, running it by-passed from a drill press, and can easily tow up to 30 soldiers at a time, though it has a stronger driving power than other by-lines.

## RAMBO

The Rambo tank was originally constructed by Browning under US Army contract #NT1025 and also by Chieftain and other companies under US Army contract #65604. A variant is called the E2. The Rambo was developed for use by the US Navy. This design is called Type 44B. The Rambo was retired in 1964. The tank lacks optics, as its primary gun is always on the point-blank range. It has a panoramic view from the turret's side.

## VALKYRIE

The Valkyrie armored vehicle was created when the submarine class was constructed. The Valkyrie is considered one of the most intelligent submarines in the submarine fleet, as the work produced by its designers, specializing in reconnaissance, projection, communications and weapon control is unparalleled. The Valkyrie's speed of sight can reach nearly eighty kilometers per hour and a sensor range of 15,000 kilometers. The Valkyrie's stealth capabilities greatly surpass those of previous submarines, and is capable of walking up to 200 meters before taking a new position. Notably, a method for maneuvering around enemy anti-submarine defensive lines is a part of the Valkyrie's principal fighting system. The pilot has the ability to respond to hostile attacks with either improvised weapons or firing on all ship within a certain distance of the enemy.

## TSAR

The Tsar tank is the standard armored tank of the German armed forces. The Tsar's speed is unrivaled for its tank class, but it is nevertheless the most vulnerable tank in combat. The Tsar tank has seven tracks. Historically, the tank treads are rounded when the tank is facing forward. It has no reverse speed transmission and does not have regular fire control systems. It lacks mudproof suspension and is covered in shrapnel shells, 12 mm and 13 mm guns, anti-tank mines, and rocket propelled grenades, and can withstand up to 30 mm bullet penetration. The tank's shell-proof armor cannot penetrate armor-piercing ammunition, while a gun-proof vehicle can.

## SAAM-7P

The SAAM-7P tank was designed by AGK Treblinka in 1943 and was designed to cope with the highest concentration of enemy aircraft and artillery. The SAAM-7P tank is considered a very complex combination of armor and gun protection. The SAAM-7P was manufactured at Treblinka under the Soviet Union's absolute supervision. In 1943, the USSR agreed to assist the Germans by producing armor and ammunition for the SAAM-7P at an equivalent price to that it would make from Ukrainian steel for the T-34-85-II, and during the armed conflict with the Germans. The armor was to be loaded in 1939 on the 13th and exported on the 26th. The SAAM-7P completed its operational model in January 1944, underwent modifications during 1943 and after the war it was assigned to the Soviet-built 2nd Brigade of the 10th Tank Battalion and was sent to Poland and later Belgium and France. This design, which it had received authorization from the 3rd Armored Cavalry Division, was designated the Armored German StuG III.

## CHOSEN

The Chosen armored vehicle is an underground enemy within the environment. The tank's ability to convert amounts to kinetic energy is based on various factors, including width, armor thickness, and mass and, with several hundred deaths at its disposal, does not rely on impressive maneuverability to achieve victory. The Chosen has been known to move through a kilometer, make thousands of smaller speed changes, and quickly shoot its way around other vehicles by surprise. The tank's maneuverability is usually known as being it's primary weakness. The armor of the Chosen's armor does much more than a tank's. This design has the core concerns of the armored tank, balance and aerodynamics without achieving any of these aspects.

## ULMIRAVY

The Ulmiravy tank was developed for use by forces in the north Atlantic region. It used a modified 30mm MT armor section instead of the standard 30mm tank mount, a 7″ plate armor protection that required less steering effort, and a new coaxial machine gun for anti-infantry and anti-aircraft purposes. The armor went through extensive research during the winter of 1991. Notably, the tank was almost entirely stashed away in the Elk Island area. The Ulmiravy was fitted with a large self-propelled gun and was intended to integrate a stabilization system designed to carry equipment, or even soldiers, for Operation Allied Force in the north Atlantic region. It is believed that due to its lack of quality controls, the tank has come to be regarded with some prejudice. The tank lacks simple antiaircraft capability, unlike other such tanks found in the region. It has a sophisticated 72mm gun, though this gun is apparently of poor quality with several rounds missing and seems to be either a poorly constructed or faulty piece.

## CAESAR

The Caesar armored vehicle is heavy, sturdy and tough. This design would cause severe damage to opponents and is generally considered to be the inferior design. The Caesar was originally designed to stop direct fire, due to its relatively high profile and exposed turret side vents. Historically, the armored tank was used only when trying to carry weapons that would go off in an urban environment, such as an AN/TPY-2 or AN/TPY-7. The Caesar tank is often used in groups of 2 to 4, but can easily hold up to 6 to be used effectively as a single tank. The Caesar tank is considered among the best in terms of durability and firepower, but lacks firepower.

## SANDSTORM

The Sandstorm armored vehicle was the first ever armored vehicle to be fielded by the Commonwealth. It was also the first armored vehicle of its type to receive retrofitting. As such it is considered a model for future models. This design would not take root in Nexus until the arrival of the Seed of Regret. Notably, this armored vehicle received the reference to its Regret variant in its specifications. The Sandstorm is considered a model for future models. This design would not take root in Nexus until the arrival of the Seed of Regret. The Sandstorm tank was based on the Modular Storage Tank.

## MONSTROSITY

The Monstrosity tank is the next tier of armored tank and the first armored battle tank on MRT system. It is considered a real tank, but rather like a hardware. Its speed is sluggish and its armor doesn't provide enough protection for its soldier.It can make a fast movement by use of 4 sensor tanks;4 tech trees, + equipment room, + electronics room. Its combat capabilities is wide and exposed its enemy including enemy tanks, making the production line much more effective. Notably, two Tech Evasion will be sent in enemy armored column. The Monstrosity tank has a greater fighting power than only regular tier-1 monstrosity. Additionally, it can play as the signature tank of some infantry units, while it provides superior firepower to opposing infantry squads or teams.Another good reason for Monstrosity tank, is that it'll have added 'Med-Brax' upgrade on its commander tier once it is placed on map.

## BISMARCK 2

The Bismarck 2 armored vehicle was developed as a modern world war II-era technology. The Bismarck 2's speed and maneuverability made it a useful military opponent. The Bismarck 2 was not a conventional tank, but was based on a Soviet-engineered hull with a weak frame and supporting armor. In the tank was built a supercharged 500 horsepower flat-six engine which heated the front and rear steel hull of the chassis. In addition, the Bismarck 2's central tire front had many vents and additional fins to increase its survivability. Notably, to confuse gunners, the Bismarck 2 tanks had two (or maybe even three) gun turrets on the front of the hull, which were actually mounted on the top of the tank.

## PROMETHEUS

The Prometheus armored vehicle was a heavily armed armored vehicle developed by Prometheus Motors Co. for the Human sector of Algol. The Prometheus is known for being one of the best in the human sector; it was developed with human technology, no machines, and is built with the most powerful components available. Its size and weight make it sturdy against the advancing armored forces of the human sector. It was designed to be armed with rocket propelled grenade launchers and the weapon for dealing with these was named the pistol, resulting in the name of the standard-issue weapon which bears the name of one of Prometheus Motors factory workers, Klavier Gavin in the sector, who became the officer of the rank of battalion chief as a result of his role in the prototype. The basic structure of the armored vehicle is simple, but practical. The tank was apparently constructed using several working sets that were laid out upon the one metal stand-base, which was not solid, and no construction parts were used.

## FANGJUAI

The Fangjuai tank was a heavyweight armored locomotive which saw widespread use in the XVI century. The tank was developed and standardized during the VII century. The tank was developed to allow mobility for troops of the Holy Kingdom. The Fangjuai's size was considered ideal for control structures and raw materials from mining in remote areas, although China had limited mass-production facilities for several industrial companies during the XII century. The Fangjuai tank is often designated as the most advanced military armor in existence. The Fangjuai tank lacks any communications system, although unlike other armored vehicles the inventory does contain communications equipment, which can provide information and acting as an alert.

## MIDNIGHT UNICORN

The Midnight Unicorn tank was developed by the <Systems Engineering> Department of United Aerospace Corporation (UAC) for its high-speed naval warfare programs, based on both the Zu-2 and the M-100T medium tanks. Initializing tank production in 2016 on Project Ranulf, this chassis was named-after the night skies. The armaments in the armored tank are as follows: Short, standard-issue 12.7mm cannon. The tank's maneuverability was optimized. One forward 6-tube turret houses a four-tube reloading armament and a single AAA launcher (AMAT) rack. Notably, one of the four turret mounts carries two recoilless rifles - the SPAAG. The Midnight Unicorn is often seen moving ahead of the section in which it is mounted.

## MARDER REICHE

The Marder Reiche tank is part of a model defined by IL OpenWar 2.0. The update also includes many fixes to the legs and armor of the autoacceleration tank, and fixed some texture errors.All updates apply only to MA3 / MA4 versions. The Marder Reiche's front hull and tail assembly are fine in 4WD with No Loot, but when running with Loot, no LT or Radio will spawn. The armaments of the Marder Reiche's turret are also fine in 4WD, but its yellow turret has been removed.Since the big bugfix above, the bug where you might not find any enemy rockets is fixed (in vehicleselectnerator, you can still shoot any rocket after it hits). The tank's ability to push back with all engine on is also fixed, so I'm confident everyone will now find their way onto the battlefield after the update.Racing was changed, but the sheer weight of the new versions will still overwhelm you. It lacks some of its original range and weakness from the SM-4, so it remains a viable, but weaker option.All 5 classes of command vehicle have their distinct strengths and weaknesses compared to earlier versions.

## PRZEMYSLAW

The Przemyslaw tank is currently in production by Russia in a order of magnitude higher amounts than they should be, due to terrible financing. The tank is often supplied with unneeded parts like bad ammunition with the usual weak damage fire immunity. The tank is known to have always been susceptible to those forces active in Poland, instead of focusing on the allied forces of the Eastern front, like previous tanks of the decade. Also there are complications in reaching the TIP-platform with lethal medium artillery (always - like from armorer 90's ary Russia built) without directly stepping on the field, since the anti-tank smoke does not always cover the entire front and from afar, the more close sector, the less exposed area gets. The engine currently based on M2 is the first gas turbine powered engine available that has high power output of 8 kW or less, which is a serious problem when the tank is used on foot rather than by vehicle-killing type of artillery which has massive power output. Also a lot of maintenance on the parts with large differences, like on modular magazines with low ammount and no provision of ammo, allowing to apply massive powder change or reloading.

## PANZER

The Panzer tank is unique among the armored vehicles in that the armor is built to resist a full range of ballistic technologies from their weapons, without requiring either complex plate layer or heavy weapons. The engine is developed with heavy recoil-reduction technologies, which means it may easily achieve a speed of 15 m.p.h. The tank lacks armor plating, yet it still resists similar impacts, without giving up any of its primary advantages. The Panzer was also designed to go into battle with a short fuel charge. The Panzer tank is considered the best protection against tank impact weapons: it is immune to fire from head-on or bullet from behind, can resist under armours and withstand a 3x3 impact at 60 km/h. The tank's armor blocks the smallest of hits from almost all relevant weapons, most of the main armament and rifle in the US, British, and Italian Armies. The tank weighs half the weight of its bigger brother, but is bigger with its smaller engines. The armaments consist of 5 cannon of each types of.

## MAHARAJA CHIN

The Maharaja Chin tank was a variant of the Maharaja-Maharaja aircraft design. Historically, it served in Taiwan as well as Korea and China. The tank's appearance in the War of Resistance to Japan is often ascribed to Shingen. The command and control center was also to be located within the tank's hull. A number of early editions bear the turret to look like it had been stolen from the Soviet Union. It lacks cross sectional armor with the exception of the turret, side rails, and superstructure. Notably, there are seven sprockets incorporated into the hull to provide full 360 degree gyros for stability when under heavy fire.

## BIG

The Big armored vehicle was developed at Hyundai ArmTech Co. Ltd in the United Kingdom as a replacement for older armored vehicles. The vehicle holds 37 x 18 mm Kalashnikov cartridge that delivers a direct hit at 240 meters. Historically, the armor of such vehicles is mostly armored but the latest version is incredibly efficient for an armored vehicle. Its appearance is much like an overweight tank when it stands (and rotates). The Big has a length of 80.9 cm, a width of 11.8 cm and is composed of two materials: ishtun resin, and aluminum armor. The Big tank is known for its hardened, highly resistant design. Its ability to fire 240 mm VZ-6 AP rounds while a top speed of 94 km/h with some stabilization is impressive and well known among tank fighting crews and combat engineers.

## ARMA I

The Arma I armored vehicle is described as similar to an LCP armored vehicle but with radar, internet, and a coaxial machine gun. The Arma I is often shown in order to demonstrate the asymmetry of this little weapon (not only side-to-side vs frontal) compared to the Sherman tank: Apart from the big turret, it is compatible with either a turret mounted rear machine gun (Fokker 800, M5, M56), or main gun only (Hitler SKS). The tank was not known in Russia prior to the Euro-War, but if it later proved useful on the Eastern front, or delivered a performance of 5-10 damage per second, I cannot imagine it being a real challenge, since this technology is based on a concept. The Arma I is a prime example of last-ditch effort made in Europe in the following decades: This report appears to have been prepared in the late 1990s. Its conclusions seem to have been incomplete or nonexistent at least until now. Although I highly doubt any Russian tank commander is capable of predicting a military transport with such a high amount of firepower at his disposal, you are basically betting on some good old luck anyway, since this concept is only too accurate. The tank was produced in every faction, giving the impression of exclusive export models.

## BARETTA CARCANO

The Baretta Carcano armored vehicle was manufactured as a replacement for the Tiger II armored vehicle, which was phased out by 1980. Historically, many 'armor' attacks have taken place on armored vehicles such as armor-piercing HE rounds on Minions of Mordor. It is often thought to be a reference to the Iron Man armor weapon used by Iron Man. Because the Shrieker tank represents the author's opinion of its capabilities to deal with shield-piercing armor-piercing ricochets, the model has the following design-status rules: Possessor: Get 600 points of armor per round (with the exception of sections damaged in said ricochets). It was designed as a more capable Noughties platform that continued to play well into the Iron Man series, although it has since been removed from later TV series. Its ability to track Hideo Kojima's characters almost flies in the face of the spirit of Raccoon City as it's semi-situational, prone to switch tactics as soon as it sees an opportunity and possesses ability to adjust itself to add more HP to its primary weapon (m4 & mortar) as well as change its shape to combat more heavily armored vehicles. However, it does carry several disadvantages that somewhat counteract its cost-efficiency to defense.

## T-34

The T-34 armored vehicle was developed by the Soviet Union during the mid-1950s and was designed for one main purpose - to get into any situation and fight in any combat zone. Historically, it proved to be a great fighter, armored vehicle and infantry tank. Although the armor plates have been modified to produce a heavier armor plate the T-34 remains an effective ground tank. The armor on the T-34 is 46 mm thick and weighs about 30 tons. The T-34 tank was developed to replace a Russian T-36/85 tank system. The tank's size and weight make it more difficult to defend against adversaries. The strong armor gives the T-34's tires sufficient grip for some battlefield maneuvers, while the armor penetrates surfaces such as road snow. The T-34's speed is very high, only 40 km/h, so it is a very fast tank for its price.

## MOUNTED KANNUSHI

The Mounted Kannushi armored vehicle is the namesake of the sub unit in D&D 4E. It comes in four armors, built into one armor package: the Indium Armor, the Oak-Ember Armor, the Emerald Armor, and the Diamond Armor. The armaments of the motorized Autotitan ranged weapons are the same as the guns of the available equipment on Earth-Devoted. The Mounted Kannushi's speed is often viewed as a weakness and this is largely due to its high energy consumption as a ground troop unit. The Mounted Kannushi's hit points are incredible, but as it is powered by only two four-wheeled mechanical legs, can not engage enemy on foot, and lacks any vehicle-equivalent propulsion it also can not use two vehicles of equal mobility. Its appearance has become a mixture of a broken otherworldly theme, with the visual design reflecting a combination of breathtaking cosmic proportions, mystic motifs, (aside from the animalistic Moonmen), and Lovecraftian imagery. Notably, the aura of the Multitool and Encylopedia were chosen as the writing materials for this-sub-unit, and is often referred to as 'The Necronomicon'. It is considered the coolest armor combination of all-time.

## MERKUT

The Merkut tank is a 3x3 steel armor machine, based on modular automotive materials. The principle structure includes two large segments of steel plates separated by thin carbon-anodized aluminum sheets. The Merkut was originally developed and manufactured by US company Damswehr against aircraft. The Merkut tank uses a 155mm turret with: high rate of fire and a low damage per second, it requires a long reload time due to its armour, it cannot be considered as a SAM (surface-to-air missile) and no AA is present inside. The tank was specially designed to fight against as much mobility as possible. The Merkut's appearance resembles a Jeep Dodge, as well as using 4-wheel drive.

## TANKMARITIME

The Tankmaritime armored vehicle is a vehicle with heavy armor protection on its turret, located on the right side of the vehicle. Notably, the rear hull has some shallow ablation places, containing large amounts of shallow armor. The Tankmaritime tank is often coupled with 5 salvager shields. Aegis Armor Bunker This is an armored vehicle used by the Nomads, designated as Courier's armored vehicle. It has cannons on the turret. Its speed and mobility are below that of Courier's tank, except while in Fast Attack mode. The tank's appearance has a tough surface, and does not have the typical heavy armor package.

## CMV HERCHMIDT 201A

The CMV Herchmidt 201a armored vehicle was previously stored in Zooburu Kuruku Pori Forest. Historically, this vehicle was used as a ground mobile base but later was used in a mobile test vehicle. This armor was manufactured for the Federal Mobile Army by a company called Aerospace Systems Mainstay. The engine for the Herchmidt 201a is a 1.5-litre V12 engine with 10 liters of ram energy. The tank's size is approximately 30 meters in length, with a weight of 1.65 tons. It is known that the vehicle is protected by an armored glass frame. Notably, Herchmidt 201a is capable of fire striking at ground level at up to 5 meters away.

## KELVIN

The KELVIN armored vehicle was developed by the Soviet's BMP medium tanks. Notably, the KELVIN used a version of the tank that was intended to battle hardened war machines. The KELVIN's ability to light infantry in a limited area allows it to maneuver more quickly and leave its path of destruction relatively safe. The KELVIN tank was unique among Soviet tank designs as it gave commanders far more tools to carry out their needs without involving rapid change of firepower. The KELVIN tank has it's own standardized technology, deployed warhead, and primary armor. It is considered to be the prototype of the modern armored vehicle. The armor of the KELVIN tank cannot be studied, as its designed concept only mentions that the tank was developed as the prototype of a 70mm twin-barreled 40mm caliber self-propelled gun. Despite this, a Syrian infantry also uses the KELVIN tank in conjunction with various Syrian old and new tanks to traverse the Syrian countryside with little difficulty.

## NO DESTROYER

The No Destroyer armored vehicle was seen in #616 of Doom's army. It was developed by the Grandnato Navy. Both its name and armored warfighter suffix indicated its armor rating was in the superheavy tank category. The No Destroyer's ability to fly in formation was minimal. The armaments were roughly similar to the Grail (german medium tank series), with two pairs of anti-aircraft cannons. Historically, it was based on the Spartan RBC-55 system, but after the Ordo Malleus detected the development and proposed a brand new design, it was fixed. The No Destroyer tank has fared poorly in the field. Its 2nd draft support car, just like its Tardis counterpart, also proved difficult to maneuver in hot spots.

## REICH TIGER

The Reich Tiger tank is a prototype based on the Teil IV (or Teil Plus if you prefer) tank, and has limited production and equipment during World War II. Historically, only the infantry of the USSR was given an armored tank; the rest of the Soviets were left out of it as well. The tank has remained, for all intents and purposes, an infantry platform despite that which is not armored, because of its robustness in other areas as well. The tank is considered a must for ground combat and naval combat, both via naval guns, torpedoes and rockets, and amphibious missions. This design proved it was capable of using towed guns and were designed by famous tank designers like Gustav, Armads (assigned by Kubinka) and Charakos (Krosig). In Battle of the Bulge, where she managed to destroy a very large Nazi army machine-gun position in one turn, it was able to destroy vehicles while still armored.

## MEZ-7G

The Mez-7G tank is one of the mainstays of the battle tanks - the armored infantry units which form the backbone of the tank division and can carry out duties between panzer or heavy tank forces. Notably, it is specialized to deliver heavy armored weaponry or support in longer battles. Its maneuverability lets it run through most obstacles. It was built to fight the Borg in the pre-Apocalypse, but its armour was taken over by Zefram Cochrane's former soldiers and is still found today. The armaments are such as: Medium Vulcan guns: 1 unit of Heavy Omni cannons, 1 unit of Minitrailers, and 1 unit of Seekers and Warp tunnels, each with 5 slots, with additional option to mount two medium main guns instead. High-end sections of the armaments of the modified primary tank are displayed on two different panels.

## ZOROVICH

The Zorovich armored vehicle was a main battle tank that first entered service in 1941. The Zorovich's size was larger than that of the standard medium tank. The Zorovich tank was developed for broad daylight combat due to its durable armor against very high caliber shots and its high-velocity projectile ammunition. The armor was composed of heavy armor of wood and an aluminum shell at the front and a welded steel rear. The tank is often praised for its plating that prevents penetration into any kind of armor except diamond fiberglass. The Zorovich tank was equipped with high caliber machine guns and several type of 5.56mm machine guns.

## TANK BALONEY

The Tank Baloney armored vehicle was made in the World War II era in the Russian Army. Historically, they are also called the Union Rheezer mk II class armored vehicle. The Tank Baloney's ability to resist 82mm-trench rifle fire is comparable to that of the Leopard 1 with its cannon capable of neutralizing multiple 95mm rifles. The Tank Baloney's maneuverability is second only to that of a Tiger III in many ways and makes it a viable defense plan for many armored teams. It has more armor than the various other armored tank types, so for instance, it does not have to spend up to 30% of its raw weapons power on armor. Notably, there are versions with 127mm for extra payload and with an additional 36mm armor to lessen fraying in the hull which makes the Tank Baloney a decent defensive choice. This design has a tremendous shelf life, as the spare parts are generally plentiful in remanufactured T-54s, making the Tank Baloney an inexpensive vehicle to upgrade to.

## ZUNA

The Zuna tank was originally designed by the British for urban combat roles, a crewed vehicle used by the RAF during the Blitz and Japanese during World War II. The tank's ability to endure heavy enemy attacks, sustained fire, or shock training was necessary for the Zuna to survive in urban areas without strategic impact. Its purpose in urban combat was driven by the extended range of its anti-tank weapons. The English-built Zuna 1 improved this abilities by adopting an eight-millimeter armor piercing projectile for its main gun and a 32-millimeter gun in each sponson. The tank's speed also improved as a result of upgraded components such as the front hull's armor-piercing polymer body and thick bulletproof windows. The Zuna tank is known for being an excellent vehicle for attacks on mechanized and road vehicles in urban areas. Its maneuverability and speed are an asset in rugged terrain and as a result, are an important part of any operational theater. The tank was designed to face mechanized and road targets of significant size and ruggedness and had little trouble withstanding gunfire against armored and road vehicles in urban areas.

## DRAGONSEEKER

The Dragonseeker tank is an armored surface vehicle. The armor system extends from the tank front armor to the front of the drive train, and the rear armor is horizontally reinforced. The Dragonseeker's speed is very good and its damage and mobility is superb. The tank's ability to penetrate armor greatly depends on the number of appliqué holes and the depth of the armor. Historically, appliqué holes made by AP-TEKONIKAKIT are popular choices and it is important to check the specific patterns you are looking at. By checking your pattern, you can pick the armor protection you will need, if you are playing on high-terrain, or even if you are on semi-field as a tank.To understand how the armor of Dragonseeker armor works, read the introduction. These details apply only if you already know how Armor breaks and armor generation and generation of tanks, in general, works.

## ADMIRAL

The Admiral tank is an armored battle tank that can be found in the final area of the battle between the Fighters and the Forces of Light. The armaments are designed to repel opposing attacks. The armor is composed of 3 types: Heavy armor that can be equipped on vehicles (see Heavy armor), Light armor, which can only be equipped on other armored vehicles, and Communication armor. The tank has the main gun mounted on top of the turret with the missile launcher attached to the turret, dealing medium damage. Its speed is significantly increased, able to travel at speeds of at least 30 meters per second (this is its default speed). Its maneuverability and mobility is significantly improved with additional tanks and transportation systems.

## HELIKOV 63

The Helikov 63 tank is a surface-to-air (SAM) system, developed in the USSR, which enables targets to dive into and destroy air defense systems, thus exposing their crews to protection from SAM fire, and provides low priority for enemy attack. This specification defines the information types for its components. Historically, two types of armor protection were provided for the Helikov 63: that of improvised explosive, and that of armored steel. It has been used for frontline performance until now. The Helikov 63 was first shown on the Eastern Front in 1944, as part of Stalin's forward-looking offensive to sow dissension among Polish and German forces fighting at Tannenberg. The Helikov 63 was developed by indigenous Soviet engineers, and prototype tanks were tested on those part of the Berlin Wall and during the Battle of Stalingrad. It is known that two of the prototype tanks, Lachin Ekostrubezh and Yashkab that were produced as part of such plans in this genre, were ultimately supplied with Israeli missile systems to counter Soviet SAM SAMs. Other variations, called Wradspanze antiaircraft, soon appeared.

## UNIT 501

The Unit 501 tank is described in this article for 6th edition and later editions. The Unit 501's maneuverability and laser firing system resemble the Tank Destroyer Class. The armaments included are just as for the Tank Destroyer Class. The longest tanks will count as 30 yards in front of the tank crew. As such, and to further simulate this, the all-purpose store van field will count as a mark, even though some of the vehicles can only fire salvos. Since the missiles will not blow out thick areas of rubble (which is unlikely for the tractor), ramming up close will be the shortest and most economical method of destruction. The Unit 501 tank is intended to be mounted in vehicles with assault weapons, as the following individuals who use automated turret attachments - e.g.

## SILVER MECH

The Silver Mech armored vehicle is meant to respond effectively to danger. It has high self-defense and sustained firepower in its hands, suitable to any kind of urban environment. The tank lacks a shell, but can be armed with well-aimed rounds. The Silver Mech tank was designed to be held in place or dismounted in battle by seven slender heavy human units. The tank has a large visor and wide interior openings for fitting two large men into a place where they will not be able to hide. It has five individual fuel tanks inside which can store 30 kilograms of fuel. Seven gung ho motor-driven troops can ride its articulated tracks for long periods of time. Historically, the armored tank was used against industrialized, guerrilla forces.

## POLLYHAMMER

The Pollyhammer armored vehicle is used in armor but not vehicle customization. Similar to the Jupiter tank, its commander protects its crew from enemy attacks and weapons, while the driver makes sure the tank does not enter an ambush. The Pollyhammer's gun system is powered by two 900mm, 865mm or 545mm automatic cannons mounted on its driver's side. As mentioned in the description, it is armored in all directions, making it one of the most difficult vehicles to pin down on the battlefield. The Pollyhammer's maneuverability makes it easier to capture fortified positions than armored infantry like infantry vehicles. Its two cannons can destroy infantry at range, but its AO system causes large casualties if fired close to a group.

## ALNUS

The Alnus tank was developed for reconnaissance on the Mare area in northern Syria and is manufactured from milled steel parts using technical techniques developed in Spain. Its maneuverability in combat maneuvers is enhanced by a rear-mounted autocannon, armament with 10x84mm and 4x62mm machine guns, and armor piercing armor. The Alnus tank is known to be under construction and taking on air support to retake Aleppo. The Alnus was originally designed as a fully armored anti-tank vehicle. Historically, at least, one tank was produced as a discrete weapon, capable of firing a projectile and piercing several light tanks, but later overhauled as a tank destroyer. During the war it was fitted with recon net anti-tank ammunition and had a high rate of fire with medium machine guns.

## WALHART BOZEMAN

The Walhart Bozeman tank was developed by Czechoslovakia to battle tanks from the Principality of Austria and Bulgaria and during World War II. The Walhart Bozeman tank has limited space and no weaponry beyond the turret armor. The armaments include a 12.7mm autoloader (Boker Kampfgruppe BBM-1), or single-barrel 12.7mm autoloader (Boker Kampfgruppe BBM-1A) with four tubes mounted in a double-barrel tripod. The engine has been replaced by a Rolls-Royce RB39-1 26 cylinder engine. Its appearance changes with loading and firing procedures and its overall capacity varies depending on the situation and ammo type. The armor of the Walhart Bozeman is retained, although armor protection around the wheels is not considered necessary for vertical-attack.

## TROOPER

The Trooper tank was the first vehicle the Imperial Army recognized as being an improvement over traditional armored tank. The Trooper tank was made for mobile infantry fighting a variety of close-range targets while slow on the ground. Its armor made the Trooper tank highly resistant to direct and indirect fire from manned armor systems. Its ability to wield heavy, rounded automatons ensured its high effectiveness against fast-moving foes. The tank was widely used by Imperial forces during the Cold War. The heavy base armor used to construct it was reinforced to withstand the constant vibration of falling surfaces. The Trooper tank is often used by the General Staff during the Great Crusade.

## SERGIO ESCALANTE

The Sergio Escalante armored vehicle is a fairly straightforward tank with a few options (mostly mechanical) to choose from. The tank is quite fast, with a high armor penetration rating, but it will take some time to gradually reduce its armor until it's as smooth as possible. The armor penetrator on this tank increases speed and stopping power, but also means that you will be turning your turret while its on. The Sergio Escalante's ability to ignore flanking defense means that it should be able to fight with no effort on the enemy's part. It was developed in 1950, but can be seen in action in April of 1944, roughly 18 months prior to the war's start. Its size allows it to move quickly to defend the front line, but that distance is also limited. The tank is often a favored link between Tanks of the Second World War and later SUVs.

## BRONZERNYANIVNYEK

The BronzernyanivnyeK armored vehicle is a land-mobile armored unit built of two mobile stages of the Krupp Solowiesel L.270 series. The BronzernyanivnyeK tank was developed as part of the project Skymind, which contributed more than 600 small vehicles in 1999. The BronzernyanivnyeK was completed in 2001. The tank's distinctive turret rises into the sky at its base. The engine compartment consists of a self-propelled vehicle engine as well as an engine dedicated to changing fuel. It lacks any external part but lacks an air filter and visor. Although, the turret is armed with a cannon, the beam of the cannon doesn't make contact with the ground, and it weighs about 17.5 kilograms, which may result in weaker accuracy for firing.

## LUKOPOLTSIYA

The Lukopoltsiya tank was designed by Red Army scientists and armaments officers of Soviet grade, and possesses heavy turret and wheel gun engines. The armaments contain light of six 30 mm cannon-70 mm howitzer-five heavy MLARs and mounted (six if the snow-bound). It was designed to support the armored defensive formations of defenders of Warsaw Pact attack lines and to rearm tanks which returned to Soviet military areas to reinforce what they had lost. The tank's maneuverability can be greatly improved by having a lorry under the side to engage attacks. It was transformed into an improved Yaroslav Pole/Magyar II which reached Podolsk and Vitebsk which were recaptured from Soviet forces in 2015 and 2016. The tank is considered an essential vehicle for protecting strategic infrastructure. The Lukopoltsiya's size compares to other armored vehicles of the GRU tier such as the, other armored vehicles of the BRD and German tier which carries 30+2 mobile gun, however they can be equipped with other fighting armament such as, of 20mm gun, or 20-mm weapon.

## SU-24 MIG-21D

The SU-24 MiG-21D armored vehicle is a prototype of a supersonic long-range fighter. The SU-24 MiG-21D tank is often mentioned by various people of its genre. It has no weapons or ammunition but some 'comfy' gear. The engine is mounted on a large reinforced main structure and the internal structure is simple and straightforward. More about the SU-24 MiG-21D: The SU-24-1 is a model of a one-man Su-24, or AD-43 armored long-range fighter, considered the best all-around fighter in the world. It is considered one of the most important Russian combat fighter of all time. The armor is mainly composed of at least six armor plates (10×20×10) as well as abcess structural stabilizers (2×1×1) that reinforce against the amount of guns on the fighter. The tank is known by various servicemembers and has a good firepower.

## KU-95

The KU-95 tank was a Light Tank produced by Sempra. Its armor should be described in numerical order by parts per inch and manufactured in the state of Oregon. Its speed was at 25 km/h with 260 mm tanks, up to 38 km/h with 380 mm tanks, and at 28 km/h with 380 mm tanks. The KU-95 has 0 to 130 hp (12 to 60 hp as rated), for the same 15 tons of armor, it weighed 185 tons. It is powered by a gun system that has 65 rounds per barrel (which would fit inside the hull and any other machine gun), approximately 1.7 Calibers per barrel and maximum effective range of 90 km/h. The tank's appearance is similar to KV-1 models, but its lower load weight leads to a more compact design. The KU-95 tank was referred to as KV-1 and was employed by the Bulgarian Defense Ministry as a military vehicle until March 2004 when the service ceased production of this tank to various armed forces of the former Yugoslavia.

## BEAR

The Bear tank was a strike division of Germany's elite Artillery Wing into which many of its German veterans served. According to various sources, some became armored cars to match and some continued serving in the armored vehicles as second in command of assault units. The armaments of the Bear tank were a large number of Kalashnikov rifles, assault guns and heavy machine guns in addition to MP-47 machine pistols. Many fell into the hands of the Soviets as the Norwegians began deserting the Germans. It has a ton of tons of supplies and a heavy use of anti-tank and anti-aircraft fire, making it an outstanding gunship. Notably, no tanks were known to have ever hit Soviet vehicles. Historically, the bear had no escort due to the lack of artillery.

## PASO

The Paso armored vehicle is a nice medium tank with its primary role being long-range fighting support vehicle for infantry, and it's great for taking out enemies from all angles. Historically, the beer crate has been one of the best vehicles to get to higher ranks in chain response time. Its appearance on modern maps is that it's fairly short, but the reality is that its armor effectiveness has been increasing, making the platoon a decent enough choice for getting around in. The PvP experience is very varied though. It was developed with high stress since it's great for PvP and it's got that 900 hit point minimum. The tank was originally supposed to be like this, but was dropped due to security concerns due to the sheer amount of junk in the world, so we're just now starting to see it on the small screen. The tank is the original pre-2370-era classic on the Phobos series of maps. The armaments are that same 250hp five gun system from 3360s, and there are five head shaped cannon (pipes).

## BATRAY

The Batray tank is a tank which is currently fielded on Batray Island. Once seen in Military Ops, the tank is considered both officially adopted and also obsolete due to the conflict with Voghtro. Notably, one of the not-so-cheap modifications of the Batray tank is its lack of armor, which allows it to survive significant gunfire. It was also shown that the Batray does not carry any D-12s, which allow it to safely traverse the terrain. While not very effective as a reconnaissance vehicle, it was also seen to be a cool way to make quick escape in the morning, as it could show up at night in highly-rare spots which had no obvious patches of light to reduce the amount of fire you would have to deal with and was very handy for crawling through a forest in extreme weather. Many years later, the Batray tank is more common as a usable force pick-up or even as a raiding vehicle. Its ability to hide a full array of enemy weapons, armor types, and vehicles at the same time makes it a vital force pick-up, while it is highly impractical to arm this vehicle alone. It is known to have as many as 13 working D-12s, at least one of which can lock on to both a moving and stationary enemy by utilizing the system of electro-optic targeting with the satellites.

## MAGAZINAT KAMEN

The Magazinat Kamen tank is the main vehicle of the Ardujan Trucks Brahrok Azerbaijani company. A representative of this company indicated that on February 22, 2015 their Kamen-10 line-up of armored t... The Magazinat Kamen was produced from 1935 until 1991, when they were integrated into one system. Krikasisemi Kaziakhsi that makes up 3 of the uGogana armored t...The one we have here ( ) was produced between 1987 and 1989 under the Diakula General Tool manufacture, was self-propelled armored vehicles that could use tracks and were equipped with HEAT rockets.The main Kwiang Cuuli-8 gun was also included in the tank, for tactical value, being a wider range than the 140mm at the time. The tank was operated by two crew members (one in the turret and the other in the rear of the tank), two trainees and about 35 different roles including the artillery battalions Aheka Korem and Kechnik.Today the company employs 70 people and produces 25 million tank-trucks annually.Armored Ka-14-15 - a cross section of large diameter internal structure. The tank is often rotated out of position for maintenance. The Magazinat Kamen has evolved into a formidable fighter tank. The Magazinat Kamen's size was also a factor in the Uragan Company adopting it in 1988 as a mainstay in their line of armored vehicles.

## ZARU 1000

The Zaru 1000 armored vehicle is the largest armored vehicle made in the Empire. The Zaru 1000 tank is often seen in massed formations on the battlefield. Notably, most Zaru vehicles are protected by frontal mounted Main Gun, which carries plenty of power. It is considered to be a good match for all Terran tank. Despite this it is heavily armored, especially during movement. It was developed by Patrice Sans, notably because it is light, compact and can withstand more damage than the T-34. The Zaru 1000's speed is like that of an 11.8 ton vehicle. It was selected by the Imperial military to combat the massed mass of Armored Infantry.

## VAAS

The Vaas tank is a tough, robust tank, but no hero tank looks better than a Vaas. The engine is crafted from a truly experimental electro-magnetic alloy and is focused to match the artful artistic rigor and ultrawide maneuverability that are characteristic of it. The shape and deformation of the rifling are based on known engineering principles, i.e., simple even harmonic lattice piezoelectric converters. The tank was developed for heavy combat roles, particularly against concentrated weapons, and for night warfare, as a death driving a tank into ground or working together with anti-tank weapons in fast moving urban environment. Its powerful electromagnetic engine was specifically chosen for its unparalleled high firepower output and incredible maneuverability. It has three dimensional movement, full field frontal visibility of 120 meters and comes with a perforated metal hatch for protection against incendiary bombs.

## AIRSOFIRAQ

The AirsofIraq armored vehicle was first produced in 2013 and entered service in 2014. Notably, this model has been deployed in the field to combat ISIL offensive capabilities. The armored vehicle has an 8.5 ton weight and a crew of up to 4. The engine is a 2.5 liter V-8 engine from the manufacturer. The vehicle weighs 3450 lbs. It is considered a TOW anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) vehicle.

## HEK-123

The HEK-123 tank is in the northern Neasden belt with the M542-2 diesel. The armor and shells of the tank were sent to Kharkov but at a low rate due to the strict restrictions of the regulations and import limitations that in the USSR tank manufacture was not allowed. It was developed as a street combat tank. Its appearance and specifications were very specific. The HEK-123 tank is considered to be very interesting because of the unique characteristics of this gun. It is an uncompromising 'Iron Horde' of tanks which can guarantee to obliterate anything that appears before them and is capable of melting an iron ring after reaching some distance of 10 metres. The M542-2 is a Tank gun design that stands out for its success and is used in heavy artillery and against forces that are hardened and organized.

## COPIARI

The Copiari armored vehicle is an automatic machinegun that automatically places its pressure-proof disc along its side to generate energy upon firing. Its size is really large due to the fact that it weighs nearly 1,000 tons and its maneuverability and defensive capabilities are exceptional. The Copiari was developed after the Neu IV now. Historically, the Neu IV protected these vehicles at a great distance from a planned air force buildup, mainly in support of SAMs and antiaircraft artillery. It is often associated with the golden age of mechanized warfare and the highly specialized interest in mech warfare because of the high utility and tactics of cannons on tanks. The tank has a pair of main cannon cannons that are linked together. It was designed as a futuristic transport vehicle which could traverse through open battlefields, forests and deserts, and would drop hundreds of metal blocks and carries many vehicles.

## SHERMOBILLY

The Shermobilly armored vehicle was developed as a compromise between modularity and combat efficiency. The tank has one hull with armored plates for firepower and, on top of that, an optional machine gun turret at the front. The armaments include a 1-gun and a 2-gun under the turret. The tank's appearance is light and simple, its upper hull having special optical equipment including a colored umbrella-like lens with a reflector to help track enemies and in particular to give protection to hard hits. The Shermobilly has mounted infrared sensors for sensor fusion, a car gun to spot fleeing soldiers and rear gunner's weapon to repel incoming bullets. The tank was specifically designed for mobile formations. The Shermobilly's size and design allowed for very good maneuverability, self-protection and good protection against flak rounds (ATGM).

## Y7M8

The Y7M8 tank was one of the BMP-1s, an advanced Soviet gun with a mass of 24 tons. The Y7M8's maneuverability makes it ideal for intercepting incoming missile threats, including the R-93 anti-aircraft weapon. The Y7M8 tank was developed from the existing BMP-1 model, and served as the successor of the Y71M2, which were used by the units that replaced Y51M1. Historically, three generations of the Y7M8 were issued, which were used as variant 1 and variant 2 only, respectively. The armor was applied to two volumes of the 1st (the separate hull), 4th (both hulls) and 5th (rear), and the hull was held in place with six sections. Its tracks were also designed with three-wheeled configuration in view of the incoming missile threat and foreward BDM penetration systems.

## GREENLAND DEFENDER

The Greenland Defender armored vehicle was the last surviving tanks of the 80′st CI division (now Arctic Fire). This tank was the ancestor of the modern Russian 42-cm SS Baz, as well as the most technologically advanced, equipped armored vehicle the Soviets were to manufacture. The guard rail guns provided support for the rear tracks of the vehicle, allowing rapid movement across cold and snowy terrain. Its speed and maneuverability made it a formidable opponent. This design also proved capable of defeating smaller, more lightly armored vehicles, like the British Heavy Sterling. The Greenland Defender tank is known throughout World War II for its great internal engineering and exceptional performance. The Greenland Defender's prime example of armoured engineering was in its approach section.

## ALWASAR

The Alwasar tank is equipped with a deflector plate. The Alwasar lacks a turret, but is covered in protected armor, the front and rear ends providing protection of around 35 percent of its total weight. The Alwasar is known for having excellent maneuverability, against heavy enemy heavy tanks and outgunned high mobility vehicles. The Alwasar tank has the job of giving the tanks and infantry a cushion from artillery shells. The tank's appearance has been influenced by heavy commercial Artillerists whose service lasted from 1917-1929. The engine, like all tank designs, is legendary because of its sharpness and power. The tank's maneuverability also depends on the length of ammunition tube.

## IVAN-KIYEV

The Ivan-Kiyev tank is characterized by its 10-ton turret and 28mm coaxial machine gun, named karyakov for the brothers. The tank lacks its protected turret, radiator, side sponson, and side gun, and it lacks the power-generating pilot hall. The extra steel armor on the top of the tank is protected by mesh armor. The Ivan-Kiyev was meant to complement the low-slung turret and 20-millimeter gun of the T-64 engine-powered T-72 tank, while slightly reducing damage. The armor has been considered to be particularly fragile because of its deeply armored engine and smaller inner tubes. Historically, the painted overall coloration was used because it proved more useful in applying camouflage to urban environments (so-called airplane camouflage).

## STARGAZER

The Stargazer tank was a fast-moving armored vehicle designed specifically for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for surveillance, reconnaissance, and strike missions. It was designed to carry heavy payloads for extended operations. The Stargazer's size also makes it vulnerable to anti-aircraft fire, combined with its array of radar-shielding weapons. The Stargazer's appearance was designed to dissuade hostile soldiers from confronting the fighters. It was developed using several subsystems based on Saturn IB technology. It was ready for combat operations in April of 2010, and featured hardened technology. The Stargazer tank has a hull section of 25 m2 and a launch ramp of 16.4 m2. The armaments on the Stargazer can be used against the enemy from all directions.

## DETTENDUHR

The Dettenduhr tank is a large utility tractor. It has an armor worth of 3000 against light armor. It is often used to clear the path for tankers and delivery vehicles. The armor is tank resistant to laser fire (75%) and medium or heavy machine gun fire (80%). Its speed is only 9% of that of regular tanks. The Dettenduhr's appearance resembles a heavy tank (with a spike shaped head and reddish hat). The Dettenduhr tank is known for its unique tank height: a minimum of 20 cm when submerged at high tide and 40 cm when standing above water (relative to the ship).

## TURBIOR

The TURBIOR armored vehicle was first seen on May 7th, 2007. The TURBIOR is a multi-purpose armed transport. The tank has external armor including AMRAP, BRAC, IRAP, GPMC, TRAP and MILARAP, which cover the lower half of the vehicle. It is considered a faction tank. Notably, the TURBIOR has an overall turret hump extending up from the gas tank, over the front of the vehicle. The lower half of the vehicle is pulled apart from the front of the hull by a sophisticated drive bays. The TURBIOR's ability to be self-propelled at speeds of at least 35 miles per hour and be capable of loading and unloading multiple crewmembers is believed to come from its BRAC armor.

## EYRSÄKKÄ ETALL

The Eyrsäkkä etall tank is an armored combat vehicle. The Eyrsäkkä etall tank has an average temperature capacity of 8.6 MWe. The Eyrsäkkä etall tank is often referred to as a multipurpose vehicle and can also be referred to as a defensive or a warfare vehicle. Historically, there have been many variations of the Eyrsäkkä etall. The Eyrsäkkä etall tank was developed by the Finnish Defence industry as a weapon for naval warfare in the 21st century. Notably, the Eyrsäkkä etall tank has a trunk thickness of 4.1 meters and a cross-sectional area of 16.6 square meters.

## ANT-KO

The Ant-Ko tank is modeled after a new rifle designed by the tank that fires m4 weapons. The tank also comes with standard 750 armor piercing armourpiercing (AMOLED) wall, and improved armor protection. The armaments include a 3,8 cm 75 mm howitzer that has effective traverse of 210 degrees. The tank was exported to Russia in 2015. It is produced in Heraklion. The tank's maneuverability is outstanding, it is no surprise that in the Russian units, this tank has won 'Tank of the Year 2017' award.

## DARK KNIGHT

The Dark Knight armored vehicle is the most modern vehicle in all RPG universe. He is considered a single tank at the moment and can be started from the supply point at a cost. The armor is made of human upper armor, reinforced iron hull plating, windshield and first tier of weaponry. The tank is often also equipped with heavy weaponry, with a traditional drum launcher, a cannon or heat sink for firing or shooting high explosive rounds. The Dark Knight tank has inflexible protection systems built into the outer surface of its armor. The Dark Knight tank is also equipped with a rear turret for protecting the driver. The tank's appearance takes aim of an even combination of urban and remote combat. The tank has grown more powerful in the RPG universe, some sources claim that it uses powerful power-plants and unique technologies such as mobile telepresence system, high efficiency vessles.

## DEANTALION

The Deantalion armored vehicle was a very powerful armored transport vehicle in use during World War II, in which the driver would wear a humanoid helmet visor and torso armor, as well as an armored waist-mounted machine gun with a plating that drew off plasma. It was still used by the Wehrmacht, though it was greatly reduced in numbers than the machine gun in the German divisions used by it. It is often seen and documented throughout the archives of later time period's but rarely seen in modern-day media. The Deantalion tank lacks most of the technologies of other armored vehicles (docking, ammunition, stowage). The Deantalion was the last German armored vehicle in use. The Deantalion tank was introduced in the 80's to provide transport for the German army's special units.

## CRANE

The Crane armored vehicle is something very special. The tank was designed to protect troops during conflicts, at which point its crew were carefully assigned tactical and operational tasks. The Crane's 3 different types of ammunition are assigned to the following basic weapon systems: 64 machine gun : 60 rounds per minute, mini-propellant tank ammunition (1 rounds per minute, 600 rounds of PMM ammunition, armed with one AAV-7 Tomahawk APFSDS system, as an add-on for the MP46 rifle and SA-10 submachine gun); and 100 ammunition casings of shell-organized 0.44 mm M83 machine gun. The standard driver is selected from an assembled command class. Notably, their union can be carried out in turn-based combat; since the vehicle is single-combat-exclusive, it can be refitted to become an armed escort during battles and cooperation with the DRT troops involved with long-range missions is sometimes offered to the heavier crew members. The armaments are extremely reliable.

## BUSTER

The Buster armored vehicle is a type of armored vehicle. The Buster tank would be a model of basic tank. Its size would be half of a standard Tank. Its appearance would be classic tank as long as one could paint. The Buster tank is considered the main tank of the base army. It is a world-destroying war machine for your troops. It is often seen in battles against enemies that have tanks and thus makes, what is called much stronger tank, an essential part of your army.

## BELTZ

The Beltz tank was developed by Steel Dynamics. For eight years it had received USAF MIL-STD-810 acceptance tests. It has gone through multiple engine, computer, weapons and survivability tests including simulated Syrian troop concentrations, large-scale medium-range tank fire, desert tests, mudslide tests, and closed vehicle courses. The tank's radar continues to operate despite stress tests. It was incorporated in the Ausf. A (SU-22) and AIs (Su-27) generation. The armor did not meet USAF standards and corrosion began when the armor was replaced when it became fitted with the Breitling Exo-Adaptive Evolv (AEE) System.

## ESPADA

The Espada armored vehicle is the frontline model of the Kharkov tank and is the largest and most powerful vehicle for our Army. It was originally designed for the use of the AT-Z general combat tanks under armored armor and the Kharkov series with thick-body armor. The Espada tank was modified to replace the Panzer IV on the Russian armor front in the 1982-1984 and 1999-2000 series of Soviet tanks. It took a number of years before a comparable number of new trucks, SUVs, armored Humvees, cargoes, and palletized supplies could be transported to the front. The engine block and forward hull, from the Panzer IVs, were changed. The Espada's size was also much bigger. Historically, the tanks are not up to the task in the most acute combat conditions, but they deliver impressive results and are one of the most reliable vehicles on the battlefield.

## TRIUMPH

The Triumph armored vehicle is one of two battle tanks in DLC1, with the other being the Conqueror and the Vimy armored vehicle. It appears to be built by the Warsaw Pact Armored Corps, with several parts from obsolete Soviet tanks being modified by common Euro-American suppliers.The vehicle is based on the American V-2, with some modifications for production at Mainz. The Triumph's size is slightly larger than the V-2 but is actually smaller in overall mass, compared to the British Tiger's. The tank lacks vertical swivel turret and left side sponson, while doing its best to evoke as much Exige as possible, using the Americanised style of turret with lower cheek cannons and roof shield. The tank's speed is at an extreme for any heavies with reasonable training but has exceptional speed with a barrel roll of 87°. Despite this its armour still protects well from incoming shots, despite being a more agile and durable medium tank, it's weak point is its crew only, because on a normal tank the standard crew should be sufficient to function with minimal complaints and full breakdowns.The Triumph has two lifeforms installed: a snowmobile and a motorbike. Snowmobile is named Snowshoe, and the motorcycle its Biga. Its ability to consume regenerators, turning to snow every time it stops moving makes it quite slow.

## M1 PERSHING

The M1 Pershing tank is characterized by the flexibility of its 76mm armored turret (77mm turret is available). The M1 Pershing tank is known for its exceptional low weight, thick armor, reliable engine and gas turbine engine (generating 5 to 7 hp each), high mobility and survival capability.The M1 Pershing's turret is composed of welded steel that features a high quality welded steel superstructure with steel plate sheet appliqué and a glass side armor plate. The M1 Pershing tank has a combat weight of 26.43 tons and maximum speed of 15 km/h. Its size is great with the large gun being 105 mm on the right side and 110 mm on the left. It is considered as the fifth longest tank in the world when compared to China's CNXS-113Y standard troop transporter (10 mt per) and the MBT Patton (8 mt/2400 lbs). The M1 Pershing tank was developed in the 20th Century for Japanese Army. It is the mainstay of operations of Japanese military as a battle tank. The engine used by the M1 Pershing tank has tank, gasoline engine, jet engine, diesel engine, acetylene fuel tank and propulsion system installed.The M1 Pershing tank was produced in two variants: the M1 tank containing 106 mm coaxial gun and the M2 tank containing 105 mm coaxial gun.There is a turret for both of the variants of the M1 Pershing tanks.

## AIDEN

The Aiden armored vehicle is located on an enclave in Sydney Harbor. The Aiden tank is known for being resistant to explosives, heat, radiation, steam, shock, and even his own armor. Its maneuverability allows the Aiden to easily navigate combat in a determined manner. The armaments that Aiden typically has on him include the standard 7.62mm and.  Notably, even though his Squm has no external gun, Aiden's Dire Wolf weapons system can turn on/off and even eject a powerful plasma explosive. Aiden's Ember pods also launch at least a dozen explosive blasts during combat.

## ARMEE

The Armee tank is a European version of the Submachine Gun using active protection and two hull plates built to accept extensive armor of various types. It was first used in the 1990's to fight against the attack from the Conquistadores. The tank's speed at least twice that of the Tier IV M26 Pershing and possesses better armor protection. The Armee's ability to operate through friction rather than friction-absorbing membranes ensures that the fuel tank cannot be sabotaged. Historically, the Armee took on a specialized role in a Type 30-mounted PAF. It has a crew of four, including the driver and gunner. Since 2006, the Armee can take up to 20 soldiers into battle. The tank fires dual M249-tepid cartridges, as well as one with its gun.

## SILHOUETTE

The Silhouette tank is specifically designed to withstand further engagement with electric attacks against its hull. The Silhouette tank is considered a Medium tank and, when developed in military circles, is known as a medium tank. The Silhouette was characterized as being mounted on a compact shape and being easy to maneuver. The tank is equipped with 12 more cannons, which fired multiple shells in rapid succession when fired in tandem. The Silhouette's size can make it unsuitable for coastal or urban defense, allowing its use in vast spaces. The Silhouette's appearance contrasts with other armored tanks of the same class, such as the Abrams and the German Leopard 2B, in that they lack extended frontal armor and a sloping glacis plate.

## KLEKSAS

The Kleksas tank is an armored vehicle which first appeared in Alien: Isolation. The Kleksas's maneuverability allows it to behave both in- and outside of combat. The Kleksas tank has light armor, although it will absorb 1% of any damage. The tank has the ability to speed, but is much slower than most other vehicles. The tank's speed has improved since its conception and replaces weak base movement speed in Alien: Isolation. It is considered by the Heavy Hunters to be among the better sports cars, for it has 80% faster towing ability, instead of only 60%.

## REMPELLANT ARMOR

The Rempellant Armor tank is a rank II formation tank with a rolling frame designed to deliver an effective penetrating and wounding solution against infantry and vehicles at all ranges up to four kilometers. It has a main armament of two 5.56 mm machine guns and a dedicated SMG gun mounted on the sponson. The engine drives two 380 mm cannon mounted in each sponson, firing a total of 840 rounds per minute, over the course of the tank's six hour mission. It has two individual multiple launch rocket systems which can supply one or multiple separate munition rounds per hour and have ranges of up to 3.0 kilometers. Specifications Main armament 2 5.56 mm machine guns. Compatible with the 30 mm QLF/30 L30 Maxim and M36 Auto 60mm/80 mm Russian autocannon.

## AMRODUS

The Amrodus tank is an armored steel armored car. The tank lacks internal fortification due to its use of standard modular biometric technology. The Amrodus has been used by the empire for centuries. The armaments of the tank are made from sheet metal, but have been modified for maximum armor-piercing and reloading capabilities. The tank was never manufactured to withstand battle in combat conditions, due to lack of materials to make this armor. It is often found beside Imperial stormtroopers, indicating the Imperial society's tolerance for civilian casualties. Notably, only Imperial test tanks are constructed to withstand frontal assault.

## MMVT

The MMVT armored vehicle is most commonly known as the M-72 or American Tank (Tiger 1). It lacks most of the attributes of the MAV or THVTS types but retains considerable armor protection. The tank is often upgraded to turret assembly or high agility engines. This design is uncommon in terms of production and operated quality standards. The tank has very simple features such as suspension and an ACV turret, it is not unusual to find replacement parts of all basic equipment on an armored vehicle in one piece. Notably, within a MAT16 tank - even a land vehicle with no weapons - there is very little need to disassemble the vehicle for maintenance.

## SAGUJAT-7

The SAGUJAT-7 armored vehicle was introduced as the SAGUJAT-5; a modified, improved version of the SAGUJAT-3.--Russian Federation. The SAGUJAT-7 tank has become a model for evaluating the requirements for the armored vehicle environment. This design, with which it shares many characteristics of its predecessor, can readily be distinguished from the earlier design but differs also in many areas. The tank's maneuverability and mobility are improved; production rates have been increased; and the value of the tank is greater than that of all the Russian armies currently in the field. This also means that more customers are obtaining tank production. The SAGUJAT-7 tank has the ability to play the role of a multirole combat vehicle for combat operations in close area missions, and is ideally suited to a wider variety of roles.

## LIBERTY A

The Liberty A tank was designed by Kawasaki as the successor to the Prinz Eugen. The Liberty A is equipped with a 7 ton, light but powerful diesel engine at 550hp with anti-tank capabilities and of course, a powerful 800lb rolling hard luggage rack. The tank lacks armor along the sides and exterior, but a thick sheet of plate works effectively as per the theory, making the defense of the aircraft's cargo extremely strong. The tank's size combined with the fact that it has anti-tank capabilities, meant it was able to survive, among other things, enemy air raids on Soviet transports and heavy machinery, coming from over land without directly getting hit by aircraft. To accomplish this, a target blocking it was laid down below its rear, opening a direct path for enemy planes, meant that it could blast into the air with devastating effect. The Liberty A's maneuverability made it a viable flying target on the battlefield and the tank's heavy armor designed to resist shots from each turn gave it a fairly impressive combat record.

## TRIUMVIRATE

The Triumvirate tank is a frontal armored tank of the Royal Union, used mainly by the Federation Navy (SRF) and Scout Armadas of the Federated Suns. The Triumvirate was originally designed to be a sea-based, platform hybrid with a superior armor/caliber ratio over the Bonanzari and Bourguignon. The tank's side armor increases its armor rating against armor piercing weapons by +40%, and changes to the frontal front armor along the armor decks halves its armor penetration by 20%. This design would allow a 75mm QPX-5 and CCS to penetrate 75mm of hull armor for the same minimum damage rating as would be done with an SRF Grizzly HP32. The tank lacks the air support capability of the Bonanzari or Henachium DT-1500 if the source possesses the correct aerial equipment. The tank is often noted for its piloting skills and notable weapon inheritance, only exceeding the standard Commando by a minor margin. The tank was first introduced in the 29th century, but has not been mentioned again. It is best equipped with a DT-1500 and more commonly a Hornet (same as the Bonanzari/Henachium) but will survive against most tank artillery.

## KOLOBA

The Koloba armored vehicle is a combat mechanized armored vehicle owned and operated by the Kyungsung Army. The Koloba's ability to completely annihilate an enemy tank forces it to be relegated to a defensive role, but that must change with the Sky Destroyers, since the Sky Destroyers take the role of self-defense armor and are unable to fulfill this role for as long as the Koloba. Its maneuverability makes it quite effective at assaulting a strong enemy, while the control of the vehicle lets the Koloba achieve decisive offensive capabilities against stubborn opponents. Despite being featured in Sky Vs. Aliens as a computer-controlled enemy, the Koloba has some notable unit attributes. The land battle tank has much more room to maneuver as compared to the tank that is flying around above your heads. It lacks the firepower of its flying counterpart, but it is still heavy enough to knock down any human in its path and possess considerable armor that may offer protection to a resistance force against vehicular assault.

## TATAR ORVAL

The Tatar Orval tank was developed by the Soviet Union to combat the example of the British Royal Hussars (Hussars is Russia's nationalistic military expression). The tank lacks its main cannon and the simple horizontal (pump) turret, but the fact that it is made of cast iron means that it protects the driver and crew from external missiles. The tank's size means that it has to maneuver quickly and possess heavy gun fire for long range on the battlefield. The main weapon is the 30mm M4A1 cannon which is generally regarded as having excellent armor and firepower. The turret is equipped with iron crosspieces and its main gun is a 75mm M8 machine gun which fires a cartridge which weighs a total of 20 kg at 5200fps and achieves 2.5 targets per second. The tank's ability to defuse mines is minimal. The Tatar Orval's speed of 43 km/h offers a good chance to destroy or destroy 2 sides.

## STORMHAWK

The Stormhawk tank is a primary purpose tank. Notably, it is inferior to the M1 Sherman and Tigers. The Stormhawk is known for its excellent damage, good mobility, and incredible killing power against armor. The tank was designed with state-of-the-art fire power in mind and has been optimized for delivering it. It was developed for supply operations, air defense, and destruction of armored units. A forwardly mounted 160mm gun fires 6-8mm anti-tank rounds, without reloading, at a maximum range of 500m. The Stormhawk uses a turret on both sides, but the turret was not adjustable to comply with the changing battlefield conditions. The Stormhawk tank is made up of several elements.

## ARMORER

The Armorer tank was the final designed and built test vehicle for the new Armorer system. The armaments for the new turret were light, accurate, and plentiful. It was developed with the quick strike designation giving it an armored penetration of 20-30 mm, complete with longer range engagement radius of 20-40 degrees. However, it will provide the distribution of firepower in close to medium range, effectively competing with the strong left-sided default assault weapon (at 3000 RPM and 100 ft). The Armorer's ability to destroy small vehicles such as light vehicles is highly situational with ammunition performance suitable for most situations. The tank was initially designed to compete against modern tank designs, having been based on a very similar design to the LST-70 system, however that trend was reversed when it entered production and lost the anti-tank capabilities of the LST-70.

## ESFKA

The ESFKA armored vehicle was developed by the Russian production company Evry Defense System. Its maneuverability, mobility, and range are being improved. The engine of the ESFKA is based on the monocoque-type gasoline engine found in most Soviet nuclear vehicles. Its speed of about 50 km/h and range of about 10 km is predicted for heavy vehicles, while tanks of this class will have a speed of 1.2 km/h. The tank's size will be about 16 meters long, 13 meters high, and 4 meters in height. The ESFKA tank lacks up to 70mm of armor and has 4 wheels, while most armed units will have the same tank with 40mm of armor. Its frontal and its rear hull armor strength in various types is written as: :Shield: 5.1 Armament : 1.50 Cannon: 120mm L/70 gun & 4A76 of 4A76A1 armor, 90mm M-240 A-72 gun, 120mm GAU-8 missile and AA battery.

## DESERT FURY

The Desert Fury tank was developed by Dynatrac, who sold four of the units to various manufacturers over the years. The armaments range from armored single-barrel rocket launchers to eight ER-9 mortar shells, based on the air-to-surface KMS-2 model (named for the Desert Storm's defeat at the hands of the enemy in Operation Desert Storm). Its ability to operate over sand is one of the highlights of the Desert Fury tank, particularly on higher mountain terrain where desert conditions can lead to subsidence. The tank is often deployed on patrol or offensive missions such as counter-terrorism and sabotage; it can also provide protection from assault fire and close-in counter-terrorism raids. It has a 360° sweep at 100 meters that can cover over 15 kilometers (6 miles), and it has a 50 m (164 ft) fire load-out. The Desert Fury's appearance and mobility suggest the SGLV-1 armor system, based on the M1A3 Bradley tank, but both R&D and production changes have changed the vehicle's appearance to further resemble the Vehicle Interchangeable Attachment-equipped M5A2 Bradley armored personnel carrier (APC).

## COMMANDER

The Commander tank was developed in which the armored crew trained to operate the vehicle efficiently and defend itself. The Commander tank was developed by the Merkur company, a joint company of former Merkur mine inspectors. The tank's appearance has not changed since the mid 70s: Every aspect has been retained, but its inside dimensions have been increased slightly. The Commander's ability to pull in other tank crews improves the tank's protection, and capacity has increased dramatically. It has suffered the right- and left-hand front feet (left front facing, see photo), and the right rear facing, each separately welded in (not welded to one another). The left foot is missing (see photo), and the current position of the welds on the right front foot is not the same as on the left rear (there is so much weld spars on the driver and their partners on the Commander tank that it was obvious to any technician they got them wrong). The engine that was supposed to power the Commander tank was small and bulky.

## CARIBBEAN HUNTER

The Caribbean Hunter armored vehicle was a general purpose tank developed by Vlad's regiment of Red Beret soldiers. The tank's appearance is considered accurate to version three. It was similar to Russian T-72B3 tank, not even fully armored. The Caribbean Hunter tank is known for its silencer, situated behind the driver and made of metal rod. The armor is made of wood, curved and made of wood, straightened the hull with thick slabs of the same material. The Caribbean Hunter tank is positioned behind a movable hatch that is totally secured and positioned under the driver. The hatch opened when placing a tank in a spot and it required some insertion or removal.

## FREEDOM

The Freedom tank was officially designated NPP FA (Leader of the Panthera Group) by the Ministry of Defense, in 1988. Its specification was not publicized. Although the Technical Library estimated that they would carry 36 metric tons, NPP FA specified that the tank should have 27 metric tons. The armaments consisted of 20 mm howitzers, 38 mm mortars, a 75 mm howitzer, a 76 mm machine gun, a 105 mm machine gun, a 105 mm howitzer, a 105 mm howitzer, and a 60 mm howitzer. The tank's ability to conduct reconnaissance and to fire artillery was not compared to Soviet howitzers. The Freedom lacks a camouflage system, so it would not always be able to see enemy behavior.

## POBREC

The Pobrec armored vehicle is one of the most advanced and highly-sophisticated armored vehicles available for the enemy. The armaments aboard the vehicle include four 30mm cannons and four machine guns. The internal armor includes 6.25mm armor on the front and sides and 4.8mm armor on the roof and cockpit. Notably, the Pobrec cannot navigate more than four circles at once due to its size. The tank was developed as part of the Arab Desert Brigade (ATP), a mercenary unit of the Amerika Dynasty. This design will be operated by the Assyrian forces. The Pobrec tank was selected as an alternative to the Steyr Mark IV because of its superior firepower, endurance, and battlefield effectiveness.

## KINGDOM

The Kingdom tank is an extreme technological superiority machine. The engine was designed for its stealth role. The tank's armor is tough with glass plate-type protection between the steel plates that make up the hull and the surface area of the armor is too thick for close combat, making the tank a formidable weapon in any situation. Historically, it was used for warfare to reinforce its core capital cities, instead of deep underground bases, but now with the technology and training gained from years of use and data gathering, the Kingdom tank has expanded its usefulness in countless situations. The Kingdom's maneuverability is astounding with incredibly fast acceleration, immense horizontal armor and armor piercing rounds, wide side armor that protects the front of the hull and can impact the ground and inflict serious damage if attacked from an angle, even ignoring the weapon barrel. Equipped with two 20 mm cannons, this tank enables to shoot a range of targets very rapidly, but could be used for close combat as well.

## NEMO-2

The Nemo-2 tank is the first armored tank in the Battlefield 1 franchise. Its speed and firepower allowed this vehicle to defeat several armored vehicles, including the Jaguar, for the first time in BF1's history. It has a heavy armor and a resilient chassis, which allowed it to survive many difficulties. The Nemo-2 was placed in the Greek Army in 2010, but was not released to the public until 2011. The Nemo-2 tank is known for its bulky main gun and small construction, which makes it difficult to conceal in urban environments. It also faced small arms fire and was fast in fighting urban fighting areas. Despite this tank's impressive fighting strength, it was heavily mauled in a series of adversarial battles.

## WOLF

The Wolf tank was a relatively new armored military vehicle designed by the modern synthesis of all varieties of automotive. The armaments of this type of armored vehicle consisted of four 5cm x 2.4cm triple machine guns positioned symmetrically in the turret. The Wolf is known to have carried in its armour a anti-aircraft gun which could be used to deny aerial bombardment by aircraft. The Wolf tank is often associated with German armies. The tank has been produced in several countries - in other words, according to German industry this was the last manufactured vehicle of the APC category. The engine (VW-110O or V20-2E diesel) is compact and stands at 14.9m long, 6.3m high and 2.7m wide.

## ANVIL

The Anvil armored vehicle was designed for the armored infantry Regiment. Notably, this was one of the few occasions when the Mehdiusvs played an armored combat role, with Carceri driving this vehicle, alongside his own squad of Ransolevers. He is the commander of the pair of armoured Carceri squadrons. The Anvil tank is also surprisingly adept at racing with towing vehicles. When early in the battle his convoy becomes a blur, he slams into and even trips over the Sabre ship under him, destroying its armor in the process. The armaments of the tank include two sponsons, a 25mm cannon and up to six machine guns, including a single machine gun in each sponson. The armor is rated at 36 tons. The Anvil has also been depicted using the Bukerzastzak, a highly effective solid metal spear when equipped with rockets.

## HILLEL

The Hillel tank is composed of a bogged-down halftrack including numerous weapons mounted on it like: An additional weapon is to be added. Its appearance and functions has yet to be determined by the development staff. The armaments are to be increased into high level prototype. The Hillel is considered an experimental armament by the AI. Its fully charged reserves weigh down the tank, and might cause serious damage to the vehicle if it is not cared for properly. The Hillel lacks its weapon's secondary cannon, so it is unable to fire this important vehicle's weapons. The tank's maneuverability is incredible, but it is not adapted for driving over water.

## ARCHETYPE

The Archetype armored vehicle is an armored vehicle that fills any role from frontline command with medium tank combat team to well rounded light utility vehicle. It is known for its ability to perform like a formidable tank in field battle but not easily found in urban areas. The Archetype tank was initially developed by Koryo in former days before the automotive industry was focused on the production of heavy trucks. Its appearance was simple yet interesting thanks to its safety features with a tree form to provide a safety even at a distance from the vehicle. Notably, the armor cover held high amounts of heavy armour by traditional Soviet standards, but has gradually fallen out due to evolution in tactics. The armor cover used by the Archetype armor vehicle appears as a protective shield that protects the driver from an attacker.

## VANNA

The Vanna armored vehicle was constructed in the 2nd phase of construction. The Vanna tank is considered very heavy and has high armor capabilities. In spite of its size, the Vanna is extremely deadly. The tank's speed is 2 km/h and the acceleration rating is 400 kg/h. The Vanna tank was heavily armored, reinforced, and cooled by an external combustion engine. Its top speed is 1 km/h and acceleration of up to 400 kg/h.

## UTILITY XV

The Utility XV tank was built in the early 1990's by the Spanish military company Popular Armament Systems. The Utility XV's size is much smaller than the wide and heavy more conventional tanks. It weighs only 19,000lbs (8,000kg), has a 1,000hp engine and carries 30 rounds of ammunition. The Utility XV is often deployed in fortifications to get an edge in the hostile territory and as a part of a team that can help defend fortified positions. The tank is capable of hitting 30+ targets in a day and carrying a total of 15,000lbs of ammunition.The utility tank has 3 slots. The armaments are as follows:. Notably, this addition of ammunition is very important to expect. It can help even if the map doesn't have a lot of potential weapons.First, let's look at a few of the official features of the tank.Armour is shot from the top to the middle, at a rate of 3 bullets per second.

## STEO KRUU

The Steo Kruu armored vehicle is inspired by the Spanish armored vehicles from the era of World War II. This design foresaw the emergence of self-propelled, modular vehicles based on high-steering abilities, providing both utility and mobility. The Steo Kruu tank is considered to be the most advanced of all Spanish armored vehicle. The tank's maneuverability and power is greatly enhanced by the influence of German Luftwaffe light tank design. The Steo Kruu is often used in training tank courses for paratroopers and village guards. It lacks turret covers, shields, and armor to handle modern armor with supersonic speed and ease. The Steo Kruu has increased accuracy over its predecessor in the past years.

## IS-2SU

The IS-2SU armored vehicle is a transport-light production medium tank similar to the IS-2, though built on a diesel engine rather than a diesel motor. Its heavier weight and reduced engines did not allow it to make great use as an anti-tank vehicle. The IS-2SU is a Chinese engineering concept as it is not based on a known design (see above). The armor is armor-piercing, four times weaker than standard armor of tank is close to the vehicle's surface, but is open to bomb attacks due to the small roof. The engine can produce up to 931 horsepower with a pressure range of ~300 feet and pressure dispersion of ~0.15 in the air. Engine can be easily modified, but the guidance can be locked down.

## WHITE EAGLE

The White Eagle tank was launched on August 12, 1986. This design has 3 tier of armored armor: the AP hardness armor, the Corrosive and HE shell thickness, and the fusion armor. The White Eagle tank is often sold in the form of a PAX direct lock tank platform. The tank's speed is about 50km/h and has a crew of 12 or 14. Its crew size is equipped with four crewmen. Its appearance will be typical of a Belarusian military tank like the Shermans, Tigers and Panthers. The tank's size is approximately 46 m long with a crew of 12, unlike the Bradley series.

## FUEMONS

The Fuemons armored vehicle was the prototype and the most advanced Heavy Tank in the Imperium. The Fuemons is considered the quickest, most agile, and most powerful Light Tank in the Imperium. The Fuemons is ten times as heavy as the Golden Tiger, and has a hull bonus of +8.6 hull points and a maximum speed of 70 km/h. The Fuemons's speed is comparable to that of the Golden Tiger, however, it has both maneuverability and armor bonus compared to the Golden Tiger's +6.0 armor bonus. The Golden Tiger has a crew complement of two. It was also fitted with Power-to-Light Turret and a laser cannon. The Fuemons is referred to as the CTAF1. The tank lacks an autocannon and carries two PPCs with loader and backup packs in its main cannon and under sponson which are called poviztka.

## COPPER CHAIN

The Copper Chain armored vehicle is the primary heavy tank for the GSF. The tank has a 750mm cannon and 85mm armor at the side, but no Gun crew can traverse its width. The armor also has a variety of safety systems like plastic exotherms and explosive splashplants to ensure the crew survive into long times. The Vehicle commands are Torpedo Crew and Patrol.-- This tank is armed with the Second Gun and carries four RPG launchers, two Micros and the short-range ATGMs. Notably, it does not carry the Battery Monitor. The tank also comes with the 15mm Machine Gun. It was developed to fulfill the GSF requirement for crew upgrades.-- Tank crew have access to on-board equipment like Radar/Pulse Dispensers, Machinegun, Mask, CO2 Filter and Radar/Pulse Probes.

## ROCKER

The Rocker tank was introduced in the Third War for resources within the galaxy. The Rocker is known for its speed, resilience and reliance on organic clay-based armor. While it is quite resilient and resistant to most firepower it lacks some sort of invulnerability. The tank has massive missile tubes and plasma cannons, and its crew carry high caliber armors which are commonly preferred by mounted units or mechanized units. The engine is standard but is very quiet with no turbocharger. The Rocker's ability to carry missiles allows it to take advantage of the vehicles vast role in the suppression of wide ranges of enemy forces. It has been used as a standard assault weapon for by our military since the early days of the Mandalorian Wars. The Rocker tank is often seen running together with planetary hull bolters or battle cannons.

## LIGHTWEIGHT

The Lightweight tank is a lightweight tank from Unity with a lot of mobility. The tank's ability to traverse hard terrain gives it a good survivability in close to medium range combat. The engine is strong and the armor is very high. The tank's speed is around 85 km/h and the fire control was made almost double. Historically, it can carry 500 soldiers in the combination of a turret-mounted fire-control system and a single water gun which can fire up to 130 rounds a minute. Its appearance is rather bleak with metal on the front and small details of armor mixed with dirt on the sides and rear of the tank.

## ACZ-S

The ACZ-S armored vehicle is the size and structural integrity of a Tier 5 Battle Tank. Its speed and maneuverability is comparable to an IS-7A or T-54, but not to a Bulava Zuikyu. The tank has six gun pods, an open, exposed hull, a hull armor protection from 4-15 armor plating to be strong enough to withstand an unknown amount of shell damage, and large secondary gun turrets. The armor plating is also hardened, and is subject to constant heat damage, consistent with steel plates. The ACZ-S's appearance and features should indicate its status as a standard, Soviet armored vehicle. The tank's ability to carry large numbers of troops and ammunition, as well as the weight, dimensions, and configuration of other armored vehicles, suggest the ACZ-S as an inferior tier 4 tank.

## PANZER 1 DOBER

The Panzer 1 Dober armored vehicle was developed during the 17 years the French Army acquired it. It has received weapons, ammunition and technical expertise from the Red Army during World War II. Its maneuverability and combat capabilities make it an impressive vehicle. The tank is known to be specially armed and protected by independent systems of protection, armor, and heavy duty equipment. Its speed, range, maneuverability, firepower, and destructive potential make it among the most capable armored fighting vehicles of World War II. It has often been described by the average soldier as having the appearance of an armored monster and a rugged soldier.

## LIEUTENANT

The Lieutenant tank is described as having decent armor (medium), firepower (high), speed (nice), and mobility (dexterity). Its appearance is described as durable and well-coated. The Lieutenant tank doesn't lose any armor, does have a top speed (intact) of 55 km/h (29 mph), and its low armor means that it should be vulnerable to bullets and heavy weapons, but its armor bonus prevents it from taking any damage or penetrating any kinetic or energy barriers. The Lieutenant has four crew members, two engine and two gunners. The Lieutenant's armor is described as hard but not yet weak and given some added benefits. The Lieutenant tank was developed for application in space in situations where the tank could not be controlled by more than two units.

## ODE TO ANZIO

The Ode to Anzio armored vehicle is one of the more famous of Imperial models of the 2nd Succession War. It lacks any serious technologies aside from gliders, but its exterior is very impressive. And though it lacks armor for fear of sabotage, the prototype was still able to deal considerable damage in the hands of the formidable battle tank tier 9 with the charge armament of the John McCain-1 and its GMC 5-61 cannons. The engine was twice the power of a Mk. The tank's maneuverability was probably greatly enhanced by the 4xACG22A6 gun and its turn rate four times the level of its predecessor. It has only 23 tons of armor, but its armor permitted the vehicle to withstand direct hits and entrench from any direction, meaning that damage inflicted on it would heal back to normal.

## SAKETTE

The SAKETTE armored vehicle is an anti-personnel vehicle which has a hull of the same volume as a standard turret. The SAKETTE's size is about the same as the maximum turret-mounted HEAT-AT-AA turret is. The armor of the SAKETTE is highly resistant to frontal or flank damage. The SAKETTE tank is known to inflict only minor shoulder-fired smoke and disruptor missiles in defense of allies. Its ability to reload from the tank is largely concentrated in close-quarters engagements. The SAKETTE tank was developed by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in 1956 to provide armoured vehicles of forward-deployed power to mixed infantry, as opposed to the more direct usage of armor such as the German Phalanx light tank. The tank's speed can reach 100 mph and traverse at 80 m/sec during initial ascent and descent. Its appearance is not considered a major class-specific concern.

## HOSPIZHA

The Hospizha armored vehicle was designed in June 1947 with the market in mind. The tank lacks the Russian and Chinese characteristics as well as the U.S.-French characteristics, and that is because, under the pressure of the powerful Victory over Germany campaign, general gunners replaced the German Hydra tank with a motorized version. The engine was a low-engined one made by Donskoi, there is no sign of a tractor-motored design. The tank has an armor protection of 2,80 mm. The tank's appearance consists of a tank commander's office, a total of four or five tracks, a commander's armament with 1 x 23 mm. The Hospizha's armor protection is 2,20 mm, and its gun caliber is 1 x 39 mm. The tank's speed is 5.5 km/h, its acceleration is 10-12 km/h. The tank's rate of climb is 2,90 m. The objective of the tank is 1 mm.

## AUTOMATA

The Automata armored vehicle is a brand new category of armored vehicles. It is considered an upgrade for existing or new tanks. The Automata tank lacks the heavy armor plates normally found on newer models, and instead gains increased armor protection. The Automata is known to battle tanks equipped with larger types of armor. Its ability to mount mines is also a must-have skill for any tank. It also relies heavily on hidden underground systems and hidden cavities for survivability, with both allowing it to survive a lot of impact without losing armor. The engine only has two forms; AA or Gatling Laser.

## GRACH

The Grach tank is a piston-based armored tank which was seen in the early 90's. The Grach has slight similarities to the AT-AT, as well as other Abrams tanks. The engine has no bearing within the tank, instead being driven by the gun. It is a very fragile tank, as are most Abrams tanks in general. The armor plating on the side of the hull is more attractive, allowing for more space for children. The tank lacks a fire control system and high explosive detection rounds are used to locate a target. It is considered a top tier in warfare, able to easily endure a massive damage from fire or grenades.

## TERRABI II

The Terrabi II armored vehicle is a large ground attack and armored reconnaissance vehicle, carried by the Armored Brigade armored tank squadrons. The tank is known for its advanced technology, having a self-propelled 72mm gun and a 72mm mortar, and for allowing it to conduct a wide variety of combat missions including infantry, amphibious assault, airborne attack and anti-tank operations. The tank's size and armor rating allowed it to perform well against all types of troop combatant, and its beam-sensing system gave it superior protection against heavy armor. The Terrabi II's program was accompanied by large order books, lots of spare parts and spare ammunition, and made the armor attractive. The armor provided an excellent combat platform, as were its distinctive characteristics, such as 100mm secondary armor, multiple turrets and computer-controlled turret assembly. The engine of the armored personnel carrier is a four-cylinder fireproof diesel engine, with a top speed of 12 km/h and a top acceleration of 42 kg/s. The Terrabi II was developed for the corps under the command of Colonel Neves, with a maximum combat weight of 200 tons and a rear weight of 125 tons.

## MARSHALL

The Marshall tank was an armored tractor like vehicle developed in the mid 80s. The tank has two external stores pylons and a combination of main and auxiliary stores and can carry six armed personnel (two occupants). Its size and design has greatly improved over the years. Its ability to withstand anti-tank gun fire and its maximum armor piercing firepower is unique in its class and allow it to maintain its speed at high speeds without being destroyed. It lacks 100mm of armor but is also fast and agile with both trucks self-propelled and tank propelled. The armor is protected by air and/or armor piercing projectiles to give a durable performance. The tank is considered the Russian equivalent of the American M2 Sherman.

## VITRY-2000-UBR

The Vitry-2000-UBR tank was a very heavy and powerful tank developed at the Vukovar armored repair plant in Kosovo. The Vitry-2000-UBR lacks such a heavy armor thickness as a Leopard 2, as it had a thicker primary hull and been built with conventional upper glacis plate and a high frontal armor plate. The tank is often utilized by the Serbian army. The tank's appearance is similar to a standard BMP-1. Its maneuverability is not great and its gun is fixed stock, even at high powered. Historically, it was used only in the Balkans as a gathering vehicle and as a transport; however, its looks and construction made it relatively attractive to them, even if they did not fire it. The main differences between the Vitry-2000-UBR and a Leopard 2 are that in the Vitry-2000-UBR, a Sturmey, tactical guided anti-tank missile is mounted on the side of the gun.

## FRANCESCO

The Francesco armored vehicle is a new development by the Italian manufacturer. It is considered one of the most promising mobility armored vehicle of the mid-2000s. It has smooth hull interior and is mounted with sophisticated technologies to make it a tank with a high potential to achieve high performance. It has a base weight of 8100 kg with a maximum load-bearing capacity of 28.8 tons. The Francesco was developed through innovative development of design and engineering with references from aircraft, armoured vehicles, highway warfare and other defense areas. The prototype is currently undergoing three separate test missions, but it is understood that the vehicle is in the prototype phase right now.

## SIEGLINDE

The Sieglinde armored vehicle was used by the 3rd Armored Division during the American occupation of Germany in 1941 and was originally designated vehicle 555. The tank is often included in comparisons between Israeli tank prototypes. The Sieglinde is considered one of the best performing tank design of World War II, in particular its durability, durability to mud and water, fuel efficiency and overall mobility with its ability to retreat into the friendly lines before being utilized for reinforcement of forces following direct resistance. The tank's size and shell weight varied from 155 mm, and some advanced tracks remained unfinished until World War II. The tank's speed and mobility were limited, as there was no possibility of how fast a sapper was able to cross the road at a given angle of attack with the vehicle. In addition, when it received the famed watercraft-like protrusion the moment of passage, the front armor of the tank resembled that of a heavily modified Sherman tank.

## THRESHOLD

The Threshold tank is an industrial era German medium tank. The Threshold tank has a detachable armored hull that provides structural support and is mobile with a flexible movement system to provide extra protection from enemy arms. Notably, the Threshold tanks are heavily armed and equipped with small arms as part of a fortress defence system. The engine for the Threshold tank was developed by Bergebroek MGK - a mechanical utility and semi-mobile gear emitter. Below is an excerpt from the technical specifications: The Threshold tanks' main armament consists of three 3x Type 99 25 mm volleys. This design is pretty new. The tank was never exported for service.

## TITAN

The Titan tank is a modified Iron Horse Tank, partly refitted with an armored hull and armored machinegun. The armor is more powerful than the Iron Horse tank and the machineguns are used more frequently, but the remaining 22 units are otherwise similar. The Titan tank lacks the second half of the Titan's cannon, but its machinegun is rather underrated. It was actually used by the Armored Corps as a mobile armored fighting vehicle. The concept had already been demonstrated by the Titan, which was modified into the Armored Land Armored Fighting Vehicle, while in operation against armored opponents. Its maneuverability was found to be faster than the Iron Horse.

## MF-44

The MF-44 tank was one of the earliest-built ships of the ancient Ming Dynasty, a few years before the effective alliance of Nationalist China and the United Nations in a plan to reach the Persian Gulf in three days with an arsenal of first-class planes and ships from Earth's largest, most able-bodied naval vessel. The armor package consisted of 4x-4x TDF welded blocks and a high-quality composite substance coating. The MF-44 tank lacks the self-propelled cannons found on earlier Chinese air crafts, and the limited range of the armor makes the project more challenging. Historically, it was very expensive for the Ming Dynasty to obtain both metal and composite armor. The engine was built on some of these components, though unlike most ships today, the power plant is both four engines and three six-cylinder crankshafts. The MF-44 tank was definitely not easy to build. The MF-44 is often depicted as a crew cabin with two berths and a number of seats in the rightmost section.

## ANTARES

The Antares armored vehicle is an APC, developed for use against vehicles of all kinds, but especially advanced ones. Its sensors and electronics are accurate enough to track the movement of warheads even in moderate conditions, and its armor gives up to 360 tons of protection on its crew. The Antares tank has a speed of 650 km/h (460 mph), and can accelerate from 35 to 40 km/h (20 to 22 mph) in one hour. It can carry 160 kilograms of weapons. Historically, its primary weapons consist of long-range laser cannons and 2.7-meter (10-foot) anti-ship missiles, supplemented by a crew of six. Notably, the Antares has very good stability and very strong drive on its tracks and rolling tracks, making it a very reliable tank. The vehicle is essentially a cramped room which can be filled with explosives to destroy any standing threat, provide cover and fire support in case of a critical battle, provide cover for retaking positions or defending the artillery if attacked. The Antares tank is often used by ground forces as part of a mobile artillery system.

## YAZDI JEVEL

The Yazdi Jevel tank was developed and fitted to tanks of the Third Army in 19th century using lightweight materials. The Yazdi Jevel tank has been named KV-1 for the Jevel factory at Kanai, Iraq. The tank was at first developed in part as a replacement for the AA Empiricist 4x. The armor protection aspect of the design included the main armor casing with integrated liner plate. By the winter of 1941, 7 prototypes were produced in version 17 (MPI 173) and not all were registered as AA Empiricist 4x. The tank was later modified with all-new parts such as turret cradle, turret and light ammunition loading system, fuel tanks, different gun(s) and small missile detection systems. The Yazdi Jevel's speed of 7 m/s proved to be too slow for the armor and infantry fighting maneuvers being practiced during 1944.

## DER REDE ROTTEN

The Der Rede Rotten armored vehicle was the prototype of the armored tank schematics, it was taken into the Simgaszov-Stalin era; when the tank was christened by the German Walter W. Koenig, it was similar in appearance to the usual partially armored combat car of that era. Its maneuverability was unknown at first, but by the end of that war, the tank was proven to have superior tank warfare capabilities, an especially encouraging factor in its battle against Soviet tank. The armaments consists of two 10mm machineguns, a high-velocity 50-mm gun and one 5-thorch anti-tank missile. This design allows a movement path wide enough to escape hit by the incoming anti-tank missiles, though is vulnerable to heavy artillery fire. The Der Rede Rotten lacks radar in case of close contact, but its armor still allowed it to get by better than most battlefield vehicles. It is armored with 15 mm armor thickness on the tracks and in front of the tank, while moving, and mounted on a cast iron chassis with small radio stowing box on its front.

## TILBURG 158

The Tilburg 158 tank is a close-support tank, with armament of 82mm main cannon, guided 18-mm mortars and rocket propelled grenades. At maximum range it can annihilate a battalion. One or two protection towers can withstand hits from 18- and 20-mm (used in M80 tanks) rockets, without direct hits, and lower armor and higher casualty rate. It is compact and extremely reliable. The armor must be spared in case of close encounter. The tank lacks backup armament and has to be protected with 4F-8 armored personnel carriers.

## SIGRID

The Sigrid armored vehicle was introduced into service in 1.17. This design used a large defensive tube which provided far greater protection than many other armored vehicles at the time. The armaments used ranged from direct fire weapons to heavy and special ammunition. The Sigrid was the largest armored vehicle manufactured by Mars Corporation and replaced the Mark IV into Mars Corporation's flagship in service with the Terran Alliance. Its size, durability, and firepower allowed it to be a formidable opponent at any range or depth. Historically, it was employed by the Grand Army of the Republic as part of the famed 104th Operations. Its ability to infiltrate in armored personnel carriers gave the Republic the ability to defeat effectively any superior enemy.

## YUMA

The Yuma armored vehicle was constructed in the early 1970s by Korean company Type 45, recently revived and mass produced by South Korea's Korea Association of R & T Transmission Companies to replace the earlier YM249, which was abandoned due to growing rusting into spoil and causing problems while still in service. The Yuma was originally constructed using Mark 26 armored recovery axles and 063 plastic shock absorbing armor plates for its cargo space, which made handling vulnerable to roadside bombs, C4 explosive charges, and smoke grenades. The Yuma was also modified to its SS-1 configuration (is equipped with smoke grenade launchers). The tank is often seen firing an anti-tank weapon in combat. It is short in service life from 1972 to 1977, and there is some dispute as to whether the Yuma actually stopped performing in 1995. Historically, the Yuma is used extensively in highly aggressive operations.

## SALAMI

The Salami armored vehicle was constructed by the T-70B main battle tank and was approved to serve as a military vehicle. This design features powerful armor and constructed to allow total tank assault capabilities for operating at reduced ranges. It was acquired by the Alabama Army Ammunition Plant in Fort Sanders, Alabama after initial fabrication. The armaments of the Salami are 33.5 mm anti-tank round with a maximum effective range of 300 meters, (500 yards) or if mounted inside an armored tank, 5.7 mm AT grenade launcher. The Salami tank was developed for the air-independent Battle Tank operation. Its speed of between 5 and 8 km/h, has been reported by the 105 mm howitzer in NATO.

## IDEAL ARMORED

The Ideal Armored tank is a tank with non-magnetic armor and can function as part of the cavalry on normal terrain. The Ideal Armored's characteristic is that it increases attack speed when moving towards enemies, whereas it decreases its movement speed when moving away from enemies. This design allows the tank to move at nearly full speed with only minor difficulties. The engine can be upgraded to provide the tank with higher speed while keeping it safe and (in certain situations) enabling it to move at considerably higher speeds. The armor and other components of the tank are resistant to damage and fire, while its weight improves its movement speed. Historically, tanks were expensive in comparison to the reasonable price of an armored vehicle (5000~1000 parts = 7000~3400 parts). The tank is known for its range and sturdy armor.

## KALASHNIKOV A

The Kalashnikov A armored vehicle is an armored vehicle that specializes in the protection and defense of personnel, equipment, and vehicles. Historically, there were several types of armored vehicles - in both military and civilian use - such as heavy armored vehicles, transport armored vehicles, and mobile armored vehicles. The Kalashnikov A tank is often considered an improved form of the earlier armored vehicle, but it has the reputation for being more mobile and maneuverable. The Kalashnikov A is known to be exceedingly durable, though it has an average hardness of 65. The tank is considered to have a tank-like profile. The engine weighs about 1,750 lbs., and is powered by an American-made 1.6-liter diesel engine.

## MARINE MAMMOTH

The Marine Mammoth tank was designed with the intention to combat rapidly moving vehicles such as tank destroyers. The tank has a thick top armor that is resistant to small arms and small calibers, and up to 13 and a half millimeters of armor. The Marine Mammoth tank is often used as a U.S. Patriot-type ground attack vehicle, and can cross roads with ease. The tank's size can make it difficult to land after rain. Notably, the Pentagon's plan to stop the Marine Mammoth's development in the 70s has caused widespread anger among the Americans and Arabs fighting against the Jordanian army. This design has been criticized for losing sight of the true purpose of armored vehicles, and does not produce tough shells or quickly moving vehicles like the French Algonquin armored systems.

## AMAS

The Amas tank was designed for use by the tank crews of the Griffin infantry unit in Algiers. The Amas's size and medium mass make it suitable for quick and intense combat. Notably, the tank was equipped with a four-tube mobile armor system. The Amas's chassis could take some heavy shelling from conventional enemy tanks, but this took two hits before it would start working properly. It used rocket-assisted traversal to move the entire tank crew away from incoming rounds. Even with that maneuver, it was capable of breaking through 3km/h (and 65 mph) of tank shells in a single push, and hitting a hit point at ranges of up to 45km, enough to sweep and crush incoming vehicles with ease.

## EINZINGER 486

The Einzinger 486 tank was manufactured by General Dynamics on the orders of Chancellor Clemens von Falkenhayn, who was the German Minister of Defence. This design continued with the introduction of the Einzinger 320. In the Summer of 1943 Hitler's forces entered Soviet territory and were attacked by Soviet forces. The armaments of the tanks were heavily upgraded during the war, and it was realized that the tanks could take away the vital capital tank KV-1. The tank's appearance didn't change much, although it had its cockpit redone for flight-control and could drive at night. The Einzinger 486 tank was deployed to Europe and China as part of the German Fifth Army during the Battle of Hosen March on 1 July 1944. The tank is known as the IH-66-01, for IH-66-01, the tank... The Einzinger 486's maneuverability was improved, the crew was given improved equipment, and they gained an antitank gun for their twenty-four-kilometer track.

## CHAKOTNA

The Chakotna tank is a rare helicopter on the Tactical Ops system. Its speed and sustained fire can make it very difficult to target, and the ability to drop enemies and make missile shots counts as of Update 15.5.9. The tank's appearance can be altered by modifying the armor slots, under the Shields submenu. Historically, this does not work during Fixed Time, but in Update 15.6.7, the armor of the tank also changed to match the changes in Update 15.6.7. The Chakotna tank was not one of the six modified helicopters, nor was it put into fixed time, but as part of the changes to Update 15.6.7, it was added in. The tank's maneuverability remains very similar to the last kit.

## EL-CHAPERONE

The El-Chaperone tank was a turbocharged Herculean experimental tank that is known to have engaged the Mongol army in between May 19, 1209 and November 17, 1211. The El-Chaperone's ability to fight indefinitely on land is recorded as only being able to take 250 casualties before drifting off to spend time at sea. It is considered one of the deadliest tank battle tanks ever created. Its appearance has varied as it is made up of numerous armor plating and various ceramic tiles. It is known to be heavily armored but, to an extreme degree, have penetrator destroyers. The engine of the tank bears an auto-locking opening that allows for instantaneous removal of armor plating. The El-Chaperone's parts are pulled from transport hulls for storage. Since this tank has autolytic protection, it can be used at very short range, but it has difficulties in penetrating or damaging most ground targets.

## GODFREY

The Godfrey armored vehicle is a medium tank resembling an E88; it appears similar in appearance to the large DF-111T or DF-122. The tank's maneuverability and range are comparable to its main armament, but its increased armor and enough armor to deflect fire allows it to adapt to fire and mission conditions more effectively. The tank's ability to adapt is demonstrated in that it was able to survive deep earth missions like that of the Salina raid; a dive patrol held by a group of Mother Earth Exploration League soldiers. The tank is often used to face off against advanced Israeli armored vehicles like those used in Operation Prodigy. This design also was utilized during Operation Goliath. Its size, maneuverability, and high speed allow it to sustain heavy damage without losing speed. The armor allows it to fight alongside vehicles of similar mass such as what the Mecha Lancer encountered, and also has enough armor to block bombs or rockets dropped on it.
